However, as is often the case, the nearby railway did not receive any such infrastructure. Since elk have been known to use railways for movement, and consistent use of railways inevitably results in wildlife mortality, research needed to be done to determine the changes in use of the railway following the implementation of wildlife collision mitigation infrastructure. The central question essentially being, now that one travel corridor had been closed to the elk, what changes will occur in the other? Here, the proportional usage of the railway prior to and following this infrastructure project are investigated, mapped, and discussed. It was found that the elk near Burwash spent a significantly greater proportion of time near and on the railway following mitigation in comparison to before mitigation. Major shifts in distribution of the elk population are shown and discussed. In all, this work shows that while wildlife collision mitigation is undoubtedly a benefit to wildlife and humans in the context of the highway, these changes may alter the behaviour of elk in unforeseen ways.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:12Z

callers, the emotionally-charged nature of their work, and serving as paraprofessionals. 
These factors impact volunteer well-being and result in high rates of turnover. This 
study’s purpose was to evaluate factors related to the recruitment and retention of crisis 
line volunteers. Seventy-nine participants completed a mixed-methods, online survey to 
assess volunteer motivations and experiences, organizational resources, burnout, and 
self-compassion. Fifty-six respondents were current volunteers, and 22 were past 
volunteers. The majority of the sample (67%) was general volunteers working in a 
helping capacity, and the remainder (33%) was crisis line volunteers. Correlational 
analyses revealed consistencies with past literature and underlined the relevance of crisis 
line volunteers’ personal characteristics. Higher motivation to gain career experience
and intended level of future education were associated with higher levels of burnout and 
shorter lengths of service. Increased self-compassion was associated with greater age, 
lower levels of burnout, and lower importance of career experience. Qualitative 
responses revealed that the crisis line volunteers desired additional strategies for coping 
with inappropriate callers and the non-interventional nature of crisis line work. This 
research demonstrated the relevance of burnout for this population, the potential of 
self-compassion in its mitigation, and the need to better support younger volunteers, 
including university students. Future research is needed to explore the benefits of 
fostering self-compassion in crisis line volunteers, for which an experimental design is 
required. Continued research into strategies for supporting crisis line volunteers such as 
opportunity for temporary leave remains crucial.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

It explores the idea that innovative work behaviour is largely a result of the facilitation of responsiveness and adaptation to internal and external influences acting on the organization and institutional actors. This study examines the intersection and overlap of proceduralism and innovation and investigates the dichotomy of structure and adaptability.
This research considers innovation as the intentional creation, introduction and application of new ideas for the purpose of problem solving and increasing the efficiency of means to ends decision making. The study comprises an in-depth investigation into New Brunswick forest fire management to better understand opportunities to harness innovation. Ten semi-structured interviews of experts and stakeholders were conducted throughout New Brunswick’s forest fire management network to determine the extent that organizational arrangements support innovative work behaviour amongst the responders. These interviews targeted publicly employed managers and Forest Rangers, volunteer fire fighters and private forestry industry partners.
This research argues that facilitating adaptation through flexibility, open communication and joint initiatives, can increase the likelihood of responders deciding to exhibit discretionary effort and extra role innovative behaviours. Through practices like inter-organizational training initiatives and joint after action reviews, innovation can be promoted at an individual level for the benefit of the entire organization and the forest fire fighting network.
Conceptually, this research contributes to an under-researched region of Canadian forest fire management, and provides a conceptual base for future comparative projects amongst Canadian provinces to better understand network working within and between provinces.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:16Z

various environmental issues, there has been a surge in co-management initiatives that bridge
Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western scientific knowledge. It is known that Western
science alone cannot solve various issues stemming from climate change, but when it is
equitably bridged with Traditional Ecological Knowledge there is the possibility to address these
challenges. This paper aims to determine whether co-management is effective for solving
complex environmental issues. Specifically, it assesses whether it is possible to equitably bridge
Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western scientific knowledge in co-management
arrangements. To assess the successes and challenges of bridging knowledge systems in comanagement
initiatives, this paper consists of a literature review of co-management in Canada
along with three case studies with interviews from academics who have been involved in the
respective case studies. The case studies exemplify many challenges associated with equitably
bridging Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western scientific knowledge in co-management
initiatives, notably how there is a hierarchy of knowledge where Western science is favoured,
issues of mistrust, and ultimately, an undervaluing of the importance of Traditional Ecological
Knowledge. The case studies demonstrate the successes of these co-management initiatives,
although there is arguably more work that needs to be done to equitably bridge these knowledge
systems, such as through a Two-Eyed Seeing approach. Overall, co-management and equitable
knowledge bridging has the potential to tackle complex environmental issues while also bringing
Indigenous voices and knowledges to the environmental discourse, which have been historically
ignored and devalued through colonial systems and policies.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

Two studies examined the relationship between cannabis use and self-regulation among undergraduates. The first study (N = 248), an online survey, found that cannabis, alcohol, and cigarette use were related to lower levels of self-regulation. Among these substances, multiple regression analyses showed that cannabis use uniquely predicted lower levels of self-control and executive functioning when controlling for impression management. The second study (N = 31) compared regular cannabis users (n = 11) to nonusers (n = 15) on self-regulation performance following an ego depletion task. The depletion manipulation task required participants to choose between many everyday products, recreational substances, and occupations. To ensure the depletion task was effective, depleted nonusers (n = 15) were compared to a control group of nonusers (n = 5). The ego depletion manipulation was unsuccessful. Cannabis users did, however, perform worse on the Stroop task and a handgrip endurance task. Additionally, reported self-control from study one did not predict performance on these tasks at study two when controlling for cannabis use.

Leaders have faced increasing pressure to simultaneously decrease annual deficits, offer more services, and maintain economic growth. As a result, many leaders have intentionally and unintentionally turned to contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities, often unrecorded or recorded insufficiently on the balance sheet, allow the offering of services or subsidies through the creation of off-balance sheet obligations – effectively allowing a governing party to provide more to citizens without having to deal with the political consequences of deficits or a growing national debt. As the topic of contingent liabilities has become an area of focus for scholars, it has become clear that while contingent liabilities do not cause fiscal crises, their propensity to occur at the same time create a more fragile fiscal state than traditional debt indicators such as gross debt show.

Past research demonstrates that higher perfectionism is associated with increased depression, anxiety, and stress. However, some research suggests that self-compassion may moderate these relationships. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of self-compassion on the relationship between perfectionism and mental health. One hundred and seventy-five undergraduates (71.6% women) completed an online survey which included measures of self-compassion, perfectionism, and mental health. Results provided mixed support for the hypotheses. First, consistent with past research, analyses illustrated that self-compassion was associated with less depression, anxiety, and stress. Second, increased perfectionism was associated with increased depression, anxiety, and stress. Contrary to expectations, the relationship between perfectionism and mental health was the same regardless of self-compassion levels. Given the limitations of the current study, future research should continue to examine these relationships using different measures. Importantly, results corroborate past research which shows the potential for self-compassion in alleviating mental health concerns in students.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:44Z

Sturgeon are endangered due to anthropogenic factors such as overfishing, industrial activity, and harvesting for their caviar (Pikitch et al. 2005). Xenotransplantation is a model for conservation of endangered sturgeon species, but has not yet been performed between a sturgeon donor and a teleost recipient. The goal of this study was to create sterile triploid surrogates. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used as model organisms to lay the foundation for the xenotransplantation process for shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) germplasm to blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) surrogates. Triploid induction was tested using a heat shock method. Indicators of ploidy were examined using erythrocyte imaging and larval morphology analysis. A linear discriminant analysis was run on larval morphology traits to discriminate between 14-day old heat shock and non-heat shock larvae. As well, reanimated cryopreserved sturgeon gonad tissue was dissociated and run through a Percoll gradient to determine gonad cell isolation. A t-test revealed a significant difference in survival between heat shock and non heat shock zebrafish embryos at 24 hours post fertilization (t = 15.649, df = 4, p-value = 9.739e-05). Survival was significantly greater for the non-heat shock group compared to the heat shock group. The linear discriminant analysis reported discrimination between the heat shock versus non heat shock zebrafish embryos with an accuracy of 80%. Sturgeon cells were dissociated and colonized the top three Percoll gradient layers. The methodology employed in this study is essential to the research on sturgeon germline chimerism. More specifically, my study contributes to the production of triploid surrogates for transplantation of sturgeon oogonial cells in order to preserve valuable genetic information that is at risk of extinction.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:43Z

As such, the current study examined the impact adaptive design principles have on usability for older and younger adults. Using two websites about COVID-19 – one designed to be adaptive for older adults, and the other conventional – we had participants complete a series of questions about the content of the website, measuring their accuracy and response time. After completing the questions, participants completed a usability scale to measure how usable they found the website to be. Unfortunately, a low number of older adult participants meant that we could not draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of website design on older adults.

Interfacial NP films are often rigid and the NPs aggregate as a result of very strong NP-NP interactions. This prevents the film from correcting defects, causing poor performance. In this study polyethylene glycol (PEG) capped gold nanoparticle (AuNP) systems were investigated to potentially address this issue by tuning AuNPs’ main forces for self-assembly: electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and steric. A minimum concentration of 0.5 M NaCl was determined to be required for initial film formation at the interface from aqueous solution. Three types of PEG-capped AuNPs with various terminating PEG groups (methyl, amine and carboxylic acid) were synthesized and then tested on three different subphases pH’s (4, 6.5, and 8) to induce varying amounts of charge on the PEG terminating group. The effect of AuNP charge on NP film rigidity, morphology, and NP packing density were analyzed using compression isotherms along with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. The various PEG ligand terminating groups complicated AuNP purification and the 0.5 M NaCl subphase altered AFM and TEM sampling protocol. Results showed that, firstly, ligand functionality and charge impact both film rigidity, morphology and, secondly, that NP interfacial packing density varied with compression to create responsive AuNP films.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

vaccines that are administered to small proportions of a large population of a species,
with the property that the vaccine spreads itself autonomously. The theory behind
their use is that at-risk populations could be identified, and then quickly inoculated
with the use of a sparse number of optimally-distributed vaccines. We study the
most efficient distributions of these vaccines on graphs, creating a model designed to
determine optimal strategies for their use. In particular, we determine the minimum
number of self-disseminating vaccines that must be used to contain the spread of a
virus or contagion on several infinite graphs, as well as the best way to use a single

Taurine plays a critical role in many physiological processes, such as osmoregulation, cardioprotection, and oxidative stress mediation. Studies in other animal models have shown that taurine deficiency is associated with the progression of cardiovascular and mitochondrial diseases, as well as interruptions in energy metabolism. This study evaluated the effects of taurine on the physiological performance and mitochondrial function in brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis. Dietary supplementation of 𝛽-alanine, a competitive inhibitor of the taurine transporter, was administered over a minimum time frame of four weeks to decrease intracellular taurine concentrations. Two treatment groups were used in this study, a group of fish fed a control diet and a taurine-deficient (TD) group fed the same diet infused with 5% 𝛽-alanine. The physiological impacts of taurine deficiency were assessed through evaluating the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and tolerance to acute hypoxia through time-to-loss of equilibrium (LOE) tests. CTmax was evaluated by increasing tank water temperature at a set ramp rate until fish could no longer maintain equilibrium. CTmax was found to be significantly higher in (p=0.017), while tolerance to acute hypoxia was observed to be significantly lower (p=0.015) in TD trout than in the control group. FluoRespirometry evaluated mitochondrial efficiency at different points along the electron transport chain. Increased mitochondrial leak rates were observed in TD trout, indicating a greater degree of proton leak into the intermembrane space (p=0.0056). Activities of mitochondrial complexes I and II were not affected by TD. The average respiratory control ratio (RCR) of the TD trout was significantly decreased in comparison to the control group, indicating that a greater portion of oxygen consumption in TD mitochondria is not coupled with ADP phosphorylation and is instead dissipated as heat energy (p=0.0051). Respirometry also revealed that maximum oxygen consumption of complex IV of the electron transport chain was significantly decreased by TD (p=0.0216). Expression of complex IV protein COX3 was significantly downregulated in TD cardiac muscle tissue, indicating potential defects in protein synthesis correlated with TD (p=0.007). Our findings provide further insight into the roles of taurine, and pathology of taurine deficiency in the cardiovascular system of fish. This understanding can enable us to further gauge the effects of environmental fluctuations on this species.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:43Z

Moreover, two types of meditation—Focused Attention and Open Monitoring—were examined to determine whether type of meditation produces distinct patterns of performance in this task. In contrast to predictions, non-meditators performed better than meditators. Further, the meditators in the sample showed no preference for one meditation type over the other. In Experiment 2, at four points during the task participants were asked to close their eyes and focus their attention based on Open Monitoring meditative techniques or control instructions. It was hypothesized that meditative instructions would lead to improved performance in the two-target task. The results show a pattern in favour of the prediction, but did not reach significance.

The base of the food web in these mudflats is a biofilm containing microphytobenthos— photosynthetic microorganisms that are the main primary producers in mudflat ecosystems. Major mudflat consumers, like snails and shorebirds, can interact with biofilm in complex ways through predation on biofilm consumers as well as direct consumption and physical disturbance of the biofilm. The goal of this study was to determine the ecological factors that affect the nutritional quality (measured as content of protein, carbohydrate, and total organic matter) of mudflat biofilm. The nutritional content of biofilm was measured during an experimental manipulation of the top-down effects of key predators (mud snails and Calidrid shorebirds) and the bottom-up effects of increased nutrient availability for microphytobenthos from July – Aug, the annual period when mudflat consumers are most active and abundant. We established a repeated measures split-plot experiment at Grande Anse, in the upper Bay of Fundy, in summer of 2020 in which control plots, bird exclosures, and bird and snail (full) exclosures were established at each of twenty sites with ten of these sites randomly selected to be fertilized. We collected biofilm samples from all treatments in all sites as sediment contact cores of the top 2 mm of sediment during three sampling periods: 3-4 July, 30-31 July, and 27-28 August. We found clear temporal trends in biofilm protein and carbohydrate content, with the absolute abundance of both declining after the first sampling period and a corresponding increase in organic matter-normalized protein content. Predator treatments also had a significant effect on the absolute carbohydrate content in late August in unfertilized plots, with more carbohydrate in bird exclosures compared to controls. Fertilizer treatment significantly decreased the organic matter-normalized carbohydrate content in late July. These findings indicate that biofilm protein and carbohydrate content are affected by seasonal factors and that their abundance might not be limited by external nutrient supply (or at least it does not increase with nutrient addition). Additionally, this work shows that predators, such as shorebirds, might alter the nutritional content of mudflat biofilm in addition to being supported by it.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:09Z

Last year, we conducted a study to evaluate whether the frequency of cellphone use correlated with students’ course grades. We observed that sending out text messages was not predictive of students’ course grades, however the number of text messages a student received within a day was predictive of student's course grades. I aimed to examine this difference on immediate testing performance. Participants watched a 16-minute lecture after which they were tested on the lecture content. Importantly, students were assigned to one of three conditions: No texting condition, where they put their cellphone away, the controlled texting condition, where they decided when to send text messages or the uncontrolled texting condition, where they sent text messages in response to a prompt sent to them by the experimenter. Our analysis revealed that participants who did not use their cellphone performed better on the test than students who use the cell phone. However, there were no differences in test scores between participants in the control texting condition and the uncontrolled texting condition. The absence of these differences in the current study is likely attributable to the differences in memory performance between immediate testing and overall GPA.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

Understanding the underlying mechanics of phytoplankton C:N:P variation is a key focus of marine biogeochemistry study. We used four diatom species of different sizes, Thalassiosira pseudonana, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Odontella mobiliensis, and Stephanopyxis palmeriana, to investigate how intracellular C:N:P varies with cell volume and determine the biochemical basis of that variation. To do this, we measured the main macromolecular components of C, N, and P in addition to the cellular quotas for these element in all four species during growth at near-optimal, nutrient replete conditions. This study found a negative relationship of C:P and N:P to cell volume that is supported by clear macromolecular mechanisms. This relationship is reflected by larger size-scaling exponents of P relative to C and N. As cell volume increased, species allocated relatively more N and P to residual pools and less to biosynthesis as represented by protein, RNA, and chl a. This study demonstrates that C:N:P variation and P-allocation across a size spectrum reflects a tradeoff between biosynthesis and storage.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:05Z

In particular, quinones, a class of chemical compounds found in PM, are known to induce oxidative stress via redox cycling where the quinone can catalyze reactions that deplete antioxidants and produce oxidants. The first objective of this study is to determine if the rate of antioxidant depletion and oxidant production correspond for a number of quinones. Given that quinones can have different numbers of benzene rings and hydroxyl (OH) groups (due to atmospheric oxidation), the second objective of the study is to determine the effect of functional groups on the ability of quinones to deplete antioxidants and produce oxidants. To answer these questions, the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay and 2’-7’-dichlorofluorescein. (DCFH) assay were performed on three series of homologous quinones (1, 2, and 3 benzene rings) with increasing OH functionality. The DTT and DCFH assays measure the rate of antioxidant decay (represented by DTT decay) and rate of oxidant production (specifically H2O2 production), respectively. Out of all the quinones tested, HNQ had the fastest second order DTT decay rate constant, followed by 5,8-HNQ, NQ and BQ, respectively. Where 5,8-HNQ had the fastest second order H2O2 production rate constant followed by HNQ, NQ and lastly, BQ did not significantly produce any H2O2. Overall, it was found that the rate of DTT decay and H2O2 production do not correspond for all quinones, and that characterizing both the potential to deplete antioxidant and produce oxidants are required towards accurately representing the potential toxicity of aerosol due to induction of oxidative stress. Using Density Function Theory (DFT) it was found that semiquinone radicals can also undergo subsequent protonation and reduction reactions. These reactions are predicted to affect the overall observed rates of both DTT decay and H2O2 production based on calculated ΔGred values. It has also been predicted that BQ undergoes a reductive addition reaction with DTT instead of forming a semiquinone. This mechanism could explain the significant reduction of DTT but no production of H2O2.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:41Z

Contraction of the raccoon roundworm by humans can cause the development of Baylisascariasis, a potentially deadly disease that can also cause blindness and a variety of other negative health effects. With the largest risk group consisting of adolescents, and the lack of extensive research on the parasite within the province of New Brunswick, further understanding of the raccoon roundworm and the ecological factors influencing its prevalence is of great epidemiological importance. This study sampled feces from 8 raccoon latrines across the province to determine the prevalence of the raccoon roundworm in New Brunswick for the first time in 10 years. These results were correlated to ecological factors including sightings of domestic animals and of wildlife (excluding raccoons) determined by the establishment of night-vision camera traps across 28 locations around the region of south-eastern New Brunswick for 4-months in 2021. Fecal floatation was performed to isolate potential roundworm eggs for subsequent microscopy and DNA analyses of samples. Raccoon roundworm eggs were microscopically identified across 6 latrine locations, while 3 locations were molecularly confirmed via PCR and genetic sequencing. Fecal samples from latrines with lower roundworm EPG counts ranged from 0 – 8.3, and would be undetectable by PCR analysis, while latrines with higher roundworm EPG counts range from 76.2 – 159.6 (overall median = 5.40 EPG, IQR = 17.6). Increased incidence of Baylisascaris procyonis positive latrine samples were correlated to increased sightings of domestic animals, which may present a possible source of greater risk to humans inhabiting regions with this factor.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:50Z

Many companies have transferred to remote work models, which comes with benefits, such as increases in autonomy and decision-making power for workers, shorter commutes, and a reduction in office space costs, but also is accompanied with trade-offs, including barriers to communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, which can lead to social isolation and have a negative impact on collegial relationships. These trade-offs and changes in work have large implications for existing leadership practices, including leadership frameworks where working together and internal social processes are at the core of the framework, such as distributed leadership.
The purpose of this thesis is to examine distributed leadership in a remote work context to determine if its practices can operate in such a contradictory setting, and if they can help to mitigate the trade-offs employees and organizations see with remote work. This was investigated through using a comparative organizational case study approach, which involved recruiting three organizations who participate in distributed leadership and remote work and performing semi-structured interviews with 22 employees total.
Through conducting a thematic analysis of each cases’ data, results suggested that distributed leadership can operate in a remote work setting for organizations who do not rely on spontaneous collaborative and distributive practices, which do not transfer to remote work. Results also suggested that distributed leadership can mitigate for the negative effects associated with remote work when distributed leadership is implemented as a deliberate, structured strategy, rather than expecting it to emerge in a remote work setting. These findings large implications for businesses who practice remote work as it continues to be a prevalent practice even as COVID-19 restrictions lift, and thus it suggests a deliberate distributed leadership strategy as a potential solution to common problems organizations might see with remote work.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:39Z

There is a lack of international legal and prescriptive agreements to support the populations that will experience displacement, primarily due to dispute over how to define the group. Several valuable attempts have been made to address this oversight in the past, but the evolving discussion surrounding climate migration requires a contemporary edition to reflect a multicausal conception of movement. In response to this gap, this thesis aims to provide a definition for those displaced by climate change related causes, herein referred to as Climate Change Displaced Persons (CCDP). It will be formulated through a lens of mobility theory and mobility justice and act in accordance with existing legal instruments. The resulting definition could serve as the basis for policy development on the local, regional, and international level to address the protection of CCDPs. The evident limitation of this definition is the contradiction between pursuing policy tools and the growing segment of mobility theorists that argue against the problematization of migration through policy. In response, it will be argued that the resulting product serves as a middle ground, providing a necessary policy tool to form the basis of problem-solving solutions to mitigate human harm while simultaneously integrating the more radical basis of mobility theory to provide inroads for a critical long-term approach.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:55Z

Previous studies found that the sucralose molecule has a binding affinity for the G-coupled protein receptor, GPR52. Genetic modification using RNAi can be accomplished in relevant
mammalian cells through lentiviral-shRNA delivery methods. The aim of this study was to develop and validate research tools to knockout the novel G-protein coupled receptor, GPR52.
Plasmid DNA was purified and validated from transformed E. coli cultures. HEK293 T17 cells were transfected with lentivirus derived plasmid DNA and optimized accordingly, in an attempt
to obtain replication incompetent virus expressing GFP. GFP expressing lentivirus was then used to infect healthy HEK293T17 cells followed by the quantification of the viral titre measuring
percent transfection and transduction efficiency by counting cells. Upon facing challenges during plasmid preparation, the modifications implemented made for drastic change in both culture
growth and plasmid purification and validation. Upon lentiviral transfection optimization, transfection efficiency in the pGIPZ-mGPR52-shRNA treated cells increased in not only % transfection efficiency but was found to be above 30% in the final transfection optimization trial. Similarly, we can see positive results upon optimization in both transfection efficiency and transduction progress. The validation of this genetic modification approach will allow for the development of new receptor-specific research tools and may provide insights on the function of GPR52 upon sucralose activation.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z

This behaviour is thought to be done either out of necessity – because energy from food cannot be sufficiently gained at other times of day – or out of preference – because it is advantageous to feed at night compared to other times of day. In Atlantic Canada, Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla)
feed nocturnally in the Bay of Fundy, a stopover site used during their summer migration. These nocturnally feeding birds are known to make use of a tactile feeding behaviour known as skimming, common amongst sandpiper species. While the Bay of Fundy is known to host hundreds of thousands of Semipalmated Sandpipers each year, other stopover sites in Atlantic Canada host more diverse shorebird populations. Several species of shorebird are known to feed during stopover in the Northumberland
Strait, however, there is a lack of research how these birds feed at night. We examined feeding behaviour, including foraging (pecking and probing) and skimming, of Semipalmated Sandpipers, White-Rumped Sandpipers (Calidris fusciocollis), and Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) during the day, evening, and night at Petit-Cap Beach, New Brunswick. We compared foraging rates and skim times
across species and time periods, and determined the predictors behind these behaviours, to understand what drives nocturnal feeding. At night, we found that Semipalmated Sandpipers skimmed more than White-Rumped Sandpipers, and seemed to switch from foraging to skimming more quickly. Both species foraged more and skimmed less when moon illumination was high, though White-Rumped Sandpiper foraging and skimming were more influenced by polychaete abundance. Semipalmated Plovers did
not feed at night, and had the lowest foraging rates during the day and evening. We found that birds that are capable of skimming will feed at night and make use of this behaviour, meaning that skimming ability of individual species likely plays some role in driving nocturnal feeding. As these skimming birds were also longer-distance migrants, we cannot rule out the energetic demand of migration as a driving force
behind nocturnal feeding as well. These findings suggest birds may feed nocturnally for both necessary and preferential reasons, broadening our understanding of the drivers behind nocturnal feeding in the Northumberland Strait",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:13Z

To cope with periods of hypoxia fish can decrease their oxygen requirements by reducing energetically costly activities such as locomotion, growth, and feeding. One way fish may alter their feeding during hypoxia is by undergoing periods of fasting. During normal oxygen conditions, fasting causes an increase in lipid metabolism, as lipids are stored in large quantities and yield high ATP per molecule. However, during acute hypoxia, lipid metabolism is typically down regulated as it requires large amounts of oxygen and can produce harmful levels of reaction oxygen species. Instead, individuals will opt to breakdown carbohydrates which require less oxygen to breakdown but yield less ATP. However, carbohydrate storage is quite limited, especially in comparison to lipid storage. While the metabolic response to acute hypoxia is well understood, the response during chronic hypoxia is still largely unclear. Over prolonged periods of hypoxia, the carbohydrate stores used during acute hypoxia may become depleted resulting in fish having to potentially use lipids to fuel their energy demands, which may result in oxidative damage to the cells.  To determine the effects of chronic hypoxia and fasting on lipid metabolism, we exposed brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to 14 days of fasting and normoxia or fasting and hypoxia at 45% dissolved oxygen. We measured the sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) - a key enzyme involved in long chain fatty acid transport into the mitochondria - to its endogenous inhibitor malonyl-CoA (M-CoA). We also analysed the maximal activity of 3hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), a key b-oxidation enzyme, as well as citrate synthase, a TCA cycle enzyme and marker of mitochondrial density. Finally, we measured mitochondrial respiration in ventricular cardiac tissue using both a short-chain (sodium butyrate) and long-chain (palmitoyl-CoA) fatty acid. We found that fish exhibited a significant decrease in the sensitivity of CPT I to M-CoA in the heart following chronic hypoxia, signifying an increased capacity for long-chain fatty acid uptake. In addition, fish exposed to chronic hypoxia had increased oxygen consumption in the heart during complex I fueled respiration. There was no change in enzyme activity or in oxygen consumption when using the short-chain fatty acid. These findings suggest that chronic hypoxia may induce long-chain fatty acid oxidation to support cardiac function despite the potential negative side effects and provides key insights into the impacts of chronic hypoxia on fish physiology and metabolism.

Further, their use and production does not satisfy the principles of “Green Chemistry”. The consequences surrounding the use of plastics can be avoided through the development of biodegradable plastics, or bioplastics. The most extensively studied and industrially available bioplastic is poly(lactic acid), which can be synthesized through the ring opening
polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters. This reaction requires a catalyst, where metal alkoxide species have been found to been effective. However, there are issues of toxicity and high cost related to the species currently being used, which poses an opportunity for new catalyst development. A more environmentally friendly option is using bismuth and indium as metal centres in these catalysts as they are both relatively non-toxic, inexpensive and reactive. Therefore, this research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of novel dimethylbismuth and -indium phenoxy-imine complexes for the ROP of cyclic esters. It was determined that the three target phenoxy-imine supported bismuth complexes can be 
 generated in situ, however, their hydrolytic instability disallows recrystallization of these complexes. Contrastingly, the three target phenoxy-imine indium complexes were all successfully synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy.

Given that different reminiscence functions, or ways of thinking about one’s past, consistently predict psychological well-being outcomes, the current investigation framed older adults’ pandemic appraisals in the context of how they reminisced during the pandemic. We predicted that reminiscence functions associated with positive well-being would predict positive pandemic appraisals and that negative reminiscence functions would predict negative pandemic appraisals. Ninety-five community-dwelling older adults (Mage = 74.31, SDage = 5.91) completed a self-report questionnaire to report the level of life-disruption they experienced due to the pandemic, how and how frequently they reminisced during the pandemic, and their current positive and negative appraisals of the pandemic. Correlational and hierarchical regression analyses revealed that higher levels of pandemic disruption predicted negative appraisals, that more frequent positive reminiscing predicted higher positive and negative appraisal scores, and that more frequent negative reminiscing was associated with higher negative appraisal scores. The relationship between pandemic disruptions and appraisals was not moderated by reminiscence. Overall, these results support the role of reminiscence in the coping process but highlight that the well-being benefit conferred by positive reminiscence functions may be explained by their role in developing self-insight relative to both the positive and negative aspects of a disruptive situation.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

As of 2021, over 3000 species of fish worldwide have been classified as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. Primary contributors include climate change, pollution, habitat loss, overfishing, and invasive species. These issues are not being combated fast enough to save species from extinction. Thus, it is vital to develop complementary approaches to conserve biodiversity. An area of research under development is cryopreservation of fish sperm. Sperm cryopreservation provides an excellent method for species conservation by allowing for long-term storage of genetic material without risk of deterioration; therefore, providing a safeguard against species collapse. Unfortunately,  cryopreservation is difficult to standardize across fish species due to its physiological complexity as well as biological differences of spermatozoa across species that influence their tolerance to the freeze/thaw process. Thus, species-specific methods must be developed. Blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) are of particular interest due to their importance as a food source for humans, excellent adaptability to being in culture, they are easy to breed, reproduce quickly, and tolerate high stocking densities. However, there is limited research on the cryopreservation of blue tilapia sperm, as the focus often lies on Nile and Mozambique tilapia. Therefore, I investigated an optimized cryopreservation protocol for blue tilapia
sperm by testing combinations of three different cryoprotectants: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol (MeOH), and glycerol (Gly), with three different slow cooling rates: -1°C/min, -5°C/min, and -10°C/min. After thawing, viability of the protocols was assessed through spermatozoa motility and swimming kinematics as well as cell membrane damage using Trypan Blue membrane stain and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme assay on seminal plasma. Results indicate that DMSO at -5°C/min yielded consistently better outcomes than other treatments, however, due to limited overall success, further investigation is required to achieve the most effective protocol. Finally, percent motility analysis and Trypan Blue staining provided the most reliable results while LDH activity and swimming kinematics were less conclusive as viability measures.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

If I could choose where my passion and talents lie, I would choose to be a storyteller—one that can write prose and tell stories that have the power to change lives. But stories have their limits in what they can do, especially if there is no one to hear them. I am not a good storyteller, nor do I know how many people will read my writing. Nevertheless, I choose to write something to make sense of the situation I find myself in. My hope is to use philosophy to navigate my complicated relation with food, and to show readers who share similar concerns a possible ethical eating relation with food.
I write in response to the growing concern and awareness around the ethical issues in food production and consumption. Ethical eating practices like veganism and vegetarianism are often presented as the ethical alternative to meat-based diets if we are concerned for the wellbeing of animals. But being vegetarian or vegan in North America still requires us to consider the ecological impact of monocrop agriculture and the wellbeing of laborers. The conundrum in choosing between eating animals or supporting agricultural practices that pollute waterways and threaten biodiversity mean no matter what food choices we make we are still implicated in damage of some sort. Attempting to juggle between environmental considerations and consideration of animals often leads to vegans, vegetarians, and other ethical food eaters being criticized for hypocrisy. Furthermore, ethical food diets are often expensive and inaccessible for poor people and effectively reserves ethical eating for those who are wealthy. With the multiple dimensions of consideration, it is tempting to only focus on one aspect as controlling one thing in response to chaos and build up an ethical response to other dimensions from there. But if all eating involves some kind of suffering or damage to the environment, the workers, or the organisms, this approach can be paralyzing. I think it is possible to do better, and to theorize about ethical eating practices that are not overwhelming and are sensitive to oppression and its legacy along the lines of race, gender, and class.
In my thesis, I argue for an ethical eating practice based on a relational ontology of food with the hopes that it provides a good method of thinking through ethical eating practices. I do this by grounding my argument in a theoretical framework that recognizes knowledge and interpretations as situated in social contexts and acquired/developed for social goals. The theoretical framework I engage with and my starting position will be explained in detail in chapter one and exemplified in chapters two and three. Using the idea of generating interpretations of the world for the purpose of change and the goals influencing the aspects of reality to emphasize in interpretation, in chapter two I articulate a relational understanding of food. Understanding food relationally emphasizes ethical issues often disregarded as unimportant or only tangential to food ethics. In this conception of food, these issues are central and inseparable from our ethical relations with food. In chapter three, I respond to more dominant views in food ethics that argue for strict vegan or vegetarian diets. I argue their lack of nuanced understanding of food affects their ability to respond to our differentiated access to foods due to our socio-economic positions and our varied responsibilities associated with them. Recognizing that we are not equally responsible in the ills of our current food consumption practices, I propose a method of developing ethical eating relations that prescribe dimensions of consideration for how we and what we ought to eat. As one possible way of navigating the relations embedded in foods, I suggest treating the food we eat as the body of a friend. Through that interpretation of our eating relations, I aim to show how our individual relations with food can be more ethical, and how managing our eating relations can incite responses to change the social structures that gave rise to the ethical issues in food production.
I cannot un-witness the impacts of climate change, institutional racism, the fact that we live on stolen lands, that my friends continue to fight against misogyny and sexism because they have no choice, and the racist undertones that sometimes appear in moral vegetarianism, veganism, and climate change activism. There is a need for food ethics for reasons from the connection between food production and climate change to issues of who can access food and what foods we should and should not eat. But trying to eat ethically while knowing there are other issues like poverty and water pollution is troubling because deciding which ethical issues to emphasize is and will remain a dilemma. We are in a pickle when it comes to eating ethically. Vegans and vegetarians are often criticized by non-vegans and non-vegetarians as being hypocritical because vegan diets sometimes are complicit in cultural appropriation—I used to be one among vegan denouncers. What I failed to recognize is that those who are vegans and vegetarians for moral (especially environmental) reasons are at least trying to make change for the better. If being ethically pure is not an ideal we strive toward, as I discuss more in chapter one, then recognizing the contradictions of our eating habits might not be as bad since it provides avenues for change. Living in a pickle may be good if we recognize the goal is not to separate ourselves from the vegetable and spice mix, but to put the pickles to good use. So, I start my theorizing from the problems in eating.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:56Z

Previous work on AuNP films at the air-water interface has shown that the addition of linear hydrocarbon oils to typically rigid and irreversible pure AuNP films has a modest effect in increasing NP-NP spacing to form more fluid and reversible films. These studies also suggested that the oils were able to effect these changes by interdigitating with the AuNP ligand shells. The present study aimed to improve upon these observed properties through the introduction of longer and bulkier oils to prevent AuNP aggregation using steric repulsion. AuNP-oil film compression isotherms and analysis by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy revealed that the addition of 1-phenyltridecane and hexadecane increased film fluidity and reduced AuNP aggregation during compression. Additionally, across all AuNP-oil combinations, no compression isotherm characteristic (i.e. earlier onset rise pressure or low hysteresis) was found to be a definite indication of AuNP-oil mixing and of being a good candidate for additional in situ analysis. The effect of increasing oil steric bulk was convoluted by concomitant changes in the stability and wettability of the oils, severely limiting the possible design parameters for oil structure. Finally, UV-vis spectroscopy measurements revealed large shifts in the λmax, which are promising indicators of AuNP-oil mixing. Therefore, in situ UV-vis spectroscopy is likely an ideal technique for assessing the mechanism by which oils mix with AuNP ligands. The shifts observed in the λmax themselves may be explained by the oil interdigitating with the AuNP ligand shell as well as changes in AuNP ligand tilt.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:46Z

Imbibition trials, and germination studies on two media were used to investigate dormancy types, while cut tests and TTC staining were used to investigate seed quality. Both species imbibe water, prefer agar as a soil medium, require only 9 weeks in cold stratification, and germinate more often when  Gibberellic Acid is present. Halenia deflexa should also receive an additional growth supplement, such as MS salts, to aid in seedling establishment. New Brunswick populations of both species had comparatively normal seed quality for this area, but an Albertan seed population of H. deflexa had significantly poorer seed quality.

called a work in the style of the famed French Architect Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the 
star-shaped bastions were built by French forces, with the help of Acadian labor, from 1750 until 
1755, when British forces sieged the fort and captured it. They held onto it until 1835.
This work takes a closer look at the designation of Fort Beauséjour as a “Vauban style” 
fortification. We will explore the varied writings and works of Vauban himself and compare 
them with the defense works at Beauséjour. 
We will also explore first-hand accounts from the building of Fort Beauséjour thanks to 
the translation efforts of JC Webster, as well as numerous secondary sources. Building upon a 
paper by Lirette and Negulic (L&N, 2021), who demonstrated using ArcGIS Pro that the high 
ground was not secured by the French, we will use the Viewshed Analysis tool in ArcGIS Pro to 
demonstrate the visibility from the fort and from the ridge, to expand on their elevation thesis.
Finally, we put these elements together to define what makes a Vauban fort so unique, 
and whether Fort Beauséjour encompasses these elements. We explore Vauban through our 
literature review and exploration of his defense works, and we then add to the literature with our 
own ArcGIS Pro viewshed analysis of Fort Beauséjour.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:09Z

Taurine fluctuations in mammals are quite uncommon because of the absence of osmotic challenges. Contrastingly, fish experience these osmotic imbalances and taurine’s ability to regulate cell volume may play an essential role in these species. Efficient cardiac cycling is essential to the growth and survival of a species in stress and non-stress environments. A decline in intracellular taurine levels has been associated with a decline in the cardiac muscle’s ability to maintain normal function under hypoxia-induced stress. Although poorly understood in teleosts, taurine has been identified as an essential amino acid in mediating Ca2+handling, reducing oxidative stress and acting as an
osmoregulator. The main goal of this study is to determine the effects of taurine depletion on the cardiovascular system in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis).
We addressed this gap in knowledge by creating two experimental groups, one fed with a 5% b-alanine supplemented feed to inhibit intracellular taurine concentrations and a control fed group. These groups were further analyzed under control and hypoxic conditions. Utilizing an invitro perfused heart preparation, we saw that cardiac function was significantly impaired. Taurine deficient (TD) hearts had significantly lower power outputs whereas there were no significant differences in cardiac output, stroke volume or muscle contractility in TD hearts under oxygenation indicating that heart function was unaffected under optimal conditions. Although in TD hearts we observed significant decreases in cardiac output, stoke volume and power output under hypoxia and even reoxygenation. Taurine deficiency had no direct effects on muscle contractility but was significantly affected by hypoxia and reoxygenation. Previous studies have shown that cardiac taurine deficiency reduced sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase activity affecting contractility in mammals and this effect translates in our brook trout model. 
Oxidative stress was significantly decreased in TD hearts compared to the control hearts under both oxygenation and hypoxic reoxygenation. Previous studies that show mitochondrial uncoupling in TD hearts in brook trout may provide the basis to understand this proposed antioxidant effect of taurine deficiency. Intracellular taurine is clearly important to support cardiac performance and stress tolerance in fish. The OCLTT hypothesis suggests that cardiac performance determines upper stress tolerance limits in fish. With the current threat of climate change, taurine supplementation may protect heart function and promote survival.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:55Z

Many of the most successful and widespread redox catalysts in industry today feature precious heavy transition metals, such as palladium and rhodium, though the toxicity and environmental impact of these metals is undesirable. In contrast to these expensive transition metals, the base main group metal indium possesses several characteristics that make it appealing for green catalysis. Indium compounds are relatively non-toxic and have potential use as Lewis acid catalysts in aqueous solution. Indium is typically trivalent and not intrinsically redox active, which necessitates the design of indium compounds in lowered oxidation states to impart redox activity. The current work seeks to synthesis and characterize the novel redox active diindane [(NCN)2In2(naphth)] (1) which will ultimately be tested as a redox active green catalyst. The synthetic routes explored and the structural characterization of the novel compounds (NCN)InBr2 (6) and [(NCN)In]2(naphth)2 (8) are reported.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:39Z

Environmental hypoxia is increasing due to natural and anthropogenic factors causing aquatic environments to vary substantially in the amount of dissolved oxygen. This decrease in oxygen is only projected to become more severe and persist for longer periods of time leading to major oxygen-limiting challenges for aerobic aquatic organisms. Low-environmental oxygen has direct effect on mitochondrial function and is known to trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. There are few studies which examine the effects of prolonged hypoxia exposure in fish, but they suggest hypoxia duration may influence mitochondrial physiology. To understand the long-term exposure effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial physiology, brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a hypoxia sensitive species, were exposed to acute (24 hour) and chronic (7 days) hypoxia. Following exposure, we
isolated mitochondria to examine oxygen consumption and ROS production rates in nonphosphorylating and phosphorylating respiration states. We found no changes in mitochondrial respiration in either phosphorylating or non-phosphorylating states across any exposure groups. However, we found an increase in the rate of ROS production following acute hypoxia but not after exposure to chronic hypoxia. The results suggest that this severity/duration of hypoxia in combination with starvation brook trout appear to be able to acclimate to longer periods of hypoxia where they can limit mitochondrial ROS production and maintain respiration.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:43Z

Asymptotic freedom allows the strong force to be studied and tested e↵ectively at high energies; however in medium to low energy regimes, it remains to be solved. To establish a deeper understanding of how particles behave at these energy scales, the A2 Collaboration
in Mainz, Germany, studies nucleon polarizabilites, which are fundamental structure constants specific to each nucleon. While these polarizability values are well established for protons, results obtained for the neutron remain unsatisfactory. To gain access to the neutron, the A2 Collaboration is using various helium targets: the cryogenic liquid 4He target that had been employed already, and the planned Active Helium target, set to contain gaseous helium isotopes. One of the main motivations for using the active target is it allows for the collection of scintillation light, which may be used to reduce backgrounds. However, the silicon photomultipliers in the prototype active volume are unable to detect the vacuum ultraviolet light emitted by the helium gas, and thus a wavelength shifting material is required. The work of this thesis examines various materials of this sort, including Tetraphenyl Butadiene, which has shown promising initial results and necessitates further examination. 
This thesis also examines detector calibrations in the aforementioned liquid 4He experiment from June of 2019, which include time and analog to digital  onversion, setting o↵set values, energy pedestals and energy gains. A brief discussion of the beginnings of polarizability extraction is also touched upon.

They use reactive oxygen species (ROS) for cell to cell signalling, although biotic or abiotically produced ROS can be harmful in higher concentrations and therefore phytoplankton must maintain ROS homeostasis. The Black Queen Hypothesis suggests that loss of function mutations carry on until the cost outweighs the benefit [1]. As it is harder for larger phytoplankton to get rid of ROS as it does not readily diffuse out of the cell, we investigated whether they would have more ROS detoxification genes, and fewer ROS producing genes. We indeed found a breakpoint at 3μm above which cells carry more genes encoding ROS scavenging. We could not determine whether there is an effect of cell size on the total genetic capacity for ROS production. The number of genes associated with ROS production and scavenging increased with larger genome size, although the slope was smaller than that of gene model size vs. genome size, indicating that less of the genome is allocated to ROS production and scavenging in larger genomes.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:48Z

First, self-compassion predicted emotional academic outcomes but failed to do so when controlling for self-esteem. Contrary to expectations, growth mindsets did not contribute to the prediction of behavioural academic outcomes. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest a benefit to matching predictors and outcomes in terms of specificity.

The Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, of which catalysis is a primary tenet and the main motivation for this project, has led the path to reduce waste production in the chemical industry. The principle of catalysis states that catalytic reactions necessarily produce less waste than stoichiometric reactions. Traditionally, precious and toxic heavy transition metals such as platinum and palladium have been used as metal centres in catalysts because of their stability, favourable redox properties, and ease of characterization. These concerns prompted this research in finding more environmentally friendly alternatives as metal centres in catalysis, such as main group complexes. Indium is a heavy main group metal that is environmentally benign. It is most stable in the +3 oxidation state and, notably, does not possess other readily accessible oxidation states. To make indium complexes redox-active, so-called “non-innocent” redox-active ligands are being explored. The current work seeks to synthesize a series of redox-active indium catalysts with varied steric bulk about the indium centre and different redox-active ligands. The goals of this study are to first synthesize and structurally characterize organometallic indium compounds with the redox-active ligand 2-amninobenzenethiol, and then test the reactivity of indium complexes with dithiolate ligands using mild oxidizing agents. A third goal is to use DFT methods to rationalize the synthesized complexes in terms of structure, reactivity, bonding motifs, and in interpreting the experimental spectroscopic data.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:13Z

assess health and mineral conditions in people or crops through concentrations

fluorescence (XRF) excitation beam in the analysis of low atomic number (Z) elements
and its comparison to the 17.48keV excitation beam for these elements. Fifty okra
samples were analyzed using XRF and results were compared to inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) values through linear correlation plots. The
correlations for calcium, potassium, and phosphorus, revealed that the 6.4keV 
excitation beam, was better suited for elements up to but not including chromium. The low
energy beam had an average R2 value of 0.74 whereas the high energy beam had an
R2 of 0.52 for the okra samples. The same procedure was used to examine standard
caprine horn samples where only calcium was examined. These supported the use of
the low energy beam for low Z elements with an average R2 value of 0.45 compared
to the high energy R2 value of 0.26. Normalization of the data was required and four
methods, Region of Interest (ROI), Molybdenum or Iron, Scatter Peak, and total area
ratio (TAR) were created and tested to determine which produced normalized counts
with the best correlation to ICP-MS. Linear correlations of the okra samples indicated
the ROI method was most promising for studying low Z elements while using the low
energy X-ray fluorescence excitation beam. The goat horn samples indicated the Fe
method provided the best correlations though all R2 were similar and the relative
uncertainties were twice the okra. More research is needed to determine the potential
of the ROI normalization method with higher atomic number elements.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:20Z

However, desire has been generally defined as an urge to engage in sexual activity, either alone or with a partner. Our scientific understanding of desire, like most things, arose from a model of male sexuality; however, there are important, gendered experiences of desire that have been overlooked, pathologized, or reduced to a numerical rating of frequency or intensity. The goal of this study was to explore how women in long-term relationships experience desire. Participants were 14 women who participated in semi-structured interviews about their desire for sex and masturbation. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Women’s experiences of desire fell into two categories: definitions of desire and manifestations of desire. Within the category of definitions of desire, four themes emerged: urge/wanting, physical sensations, embodiment/presence/mindfulness, and different headspace/alternate reality. In the category of manifestations, two themes emerged. The first, responsive desire, included descriptions of desire manifesting in response to external cues and had two subthemes: response to partner cues and response to environmental cues. The second theme in this category was spontaneous desire, where desire was described as manifesting without an obvious external cue. While desire was described as both spontaneous and responsive, responsive descriptions were more prevalent. Women’s desire is more nuanced than measures of frequency and intensity of sexual thoughts can capture, and an understanding of responsive desire is integral to understanding desire in women.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:54Z

The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is a key appetite-regulatory center, and research shows that CB1Rs are expressed in this region. eCBs have been reported to decrease the release of GABA onto DMH neurons in rats, but there are no reports of their effects on glutamate release in the DMH, despite observations that eCBs modulate glutamate release elsewhere in the brain. We hypothesized that eCBs would alter glutamate release onto rat DMH neurons with the prediction that eCBs will decrease glutamate release. To test this, we used young male Sprague Dawley rats and performed patch clamp electrophysiology to record glutamate-mediated currents in living DMH neurons. Here we show that activation of CB1R with a synthetic agonist decreases glutamate release onto DMH neurons, confirming that CB1R are present on glutamate terminals in the DMH. Surprisingly, when eCB
release from DMH neurons was induced with depolarization or high frequency stimulation of DMH synapses, we did not observe a decrease in glutamate release. Accumulating evidence suggests that another transmitter, nitric oxide, can interfere with eCB signaling, so we repeated the HFS experiment but with NO synthesis inhibited to determine if eCBs would then trigger a long-term decrease in glutamate release. Under these conditions, we observed a significant decrease in glutamate release that was mediated by CB1R activation. This research could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which eCBs control appetite.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:39Z

Thus, a wavelength shifting material is needed.

There were no significant bivariate correlations between the hormonal measures and the rumination measures. Anxiety and depression were significantly positively correlated with the rumination measures. Regression analyses with hormones, depression, and anxiety predicting rumination showed no significant effects for men.

Episodic memory involves binding event details to spatial contexts, thus, well-formed scene representations support memory for these associations. Furthermore, episodic memory and spatial processing share a neural underpinning: the hippocampus (HC). Episodic memory decline in aging is associated with HC degradation, suggesting a possibility that OA’s memory deficits may arise from an inability to process coherent spatial representations due to HC degradation. Although OA show impairments in spatial cognition, it is unclear whether these occur during early stages of scene processing, i.e., visual perception. We present a novel study which investigated age differences in spatial relational perception. We predicted that OA would perform worse than younger adults (YA) at identifying changes in object location, but not object identity. Although results revealed no differences in accuracy, OA were significantly slower than YA when identifying changes in object location, and not identity. Our findings therefore support the hypothesis, revealing an age-related impairment in visuospatial relational perception. We posit that this is due to degradation of the HC, endorsing its role in scene perception.

a paleolimnological approach for two Nova Scotia lakes located downstream of historical gold 
mines, to investigate contaminant levels within sediment cores before, during and after the 
mining periods. I then examined Cladocera assemblages to determine the bioindicator responses 
to environmental changes associated with mining, as well as post-mining stressors such as 
urbanization and climate change. Changes in contaminant concentrations and zooplankton

Results showed that participants who learned to recognize simple objects required fewer blocks to reach criterion and produced fewer errors compared to participants who learned to recognize complex objects. Participants who learned to recognize objects by sight produced fewer errors than participants who learned to recognize objects by touch.

consumption uses a large amount of dissolved oxygen (DO). When DO levels become low in a

New Brunswick lakes were examined for environmental changes using the paleolimnological
approach of comparing the relative abundances of invertebrate taxa (chironomids) from “top and

comparison of measures of water quality and invertebrate bioindicators. Most water quality
measures did not differ between categories. Assemblages indicated that there were ecological

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of this cancer is often a lengthy process and requires invasive techniques like tissue biopsies and endoscopies, and the use of various imaging modalities that requires specialized training. The development of liquid biopsy, a non-invasive diagnostic technique that requires a simple blood test, would be beneficial to help diagnose PDAC. My research project aims to identify the biological significance of previously identified up- and downregulated miRNAs found in extracellular vesicles extracted from PDAC patient plasma compared to controls. First, a number of miRNA targets (n = 17) identified by small RNA sequencing in patient samples were validated by droplet digital PCR. Some of these miRNAs (n = 4) were then used to transfect one healthy (H6C7) and one cancerous cell line (PANC 10.05) with a mimic miRNA (increases abundance) and a siRNA (decreases abundance) for each target. The number of live cells was measured 72h post-transfection by flow cytometry. It was found that miR-744-5p mimic decreases the number of live cells (n = 3, P < 0.05), while miR-30d siRNA (n = 3, P < 0.05) increases the number of live cells. Interestingly, miR-744-5p mimic and miR-30d siRNA had no significant effect on the number of H6C7 cells. These results suggest that miR-744-5p and miR-30d may both be tumour suppressor miRNAs in pancreatic cancer.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:48Z

However, these studies were conducted using simple objects that were easy to describe verbally. In the present study, I used objects that were not easy to describe verbally. I examined how mental representations differ between simple shape objects and multi-feature objects, and whether they differ when individuals learn to recognize novel objects by sight or by touch. I planned to first conduct an online matching task to evaluate the effectiveness of specific distractors. In Experiment 2, participants would be asked to learn to recognize novel objects by sight or by touch, then to identify them using both modalities. One third of participants would experience the control condition, 1/3 would have completed a verbal distractor task, and 1/3 would have completed a visuospatial distractor task. It was expected that the multi-feature objects would be more difficult to learn than the simple shape set, and that a tapping distractor would restore encoding specificity in individuals learning to recognize novel objects by touch, since these participants make use of visuospatial cues during encoding. Additionally, this distractor was expected to interfere more with learning the multi-feature objects than the simple shape set. Due to unexpected circumstances, testing was not possible.

We calculate observables such as the mass spectra, decay constants, and charge radii for several mesons. We attempt to incorporate dynamical spin effects into our results, as this has led to better agreement with observation for the decay constant and charge radius in previous works. We also compare the parton distribution functions obtained through this approach to results obtained by Brodsky and de Téramond, who use a different approach. Some differences between the methods employed to calculate Transition Form Factors (TFFs) using these new dynamics and Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSR) are noted, but the results obtained in this investigation are preliminary. Finally, we find that this approach produces a mass spectrum that agrees well with observation for numerous pseudoscalar mesons, but predicts nonphysical answers for certain observables upon inclusion of spin structure.

Micronutrient status is especially vital in postpartum women as their requirements significantly increase during breastfeeding, escalating the risk of deficiency. Moreover, in New Zealand, selenium content of most of the arable land is low and selenium deficiencies have been a major concern since first observed as white muscle disease in livestock in the 1980s. Toenail trace element concentrations have been shown to be reflective of their long-term status in several studies. The current study employs portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry as a means of investigating zinc and selenium levels in toenails of mothers and their infants from New Zealand. 240 XRF measurements were carried out using 20
matched-sets of toenail clippings of mothers and newborns participating in the MINI study. Strong linear relationships were found in the case of both elements with a “gold standard” technique, inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), that were all highly significant. These correlation coefficients were highest for zinc using the XRF system’s automated output (r = 0.82), and for selenium using normalized
selenium signals from every spectral analysis (r = 0.73). Thickness contributions to XRF concentrations were found to be minor and ICP-MS concentrations showed similar trends against thickness as with the XRF techniques. Low selenium status was suspected in 3 mother-infant pairs whereas zinc levels were in the normal range. The results of this study indicate that portable XRF provides reasonable estimates of zinc and selenium concentrations. However, further method development is required before it can be considered as interchangeable with the ICP-MS method.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:50Z

This secondary metabolite functions as an osmolyte, a herbivore deterrent, an antioxidant, and a cryoprotectant. In algae, the biosynthesis of DMSP is catalyzed by a four-enzyme pathway, which begins with the conversion of methionine to methylthio-2-oxobutyrate. While it is known that Ulva macroalgae species requires a 2-oxoglutarate:methionine aminotransferase for the first step in the DMSP pathway, little research has been performed on other alga species. Genome searches by Dr. Waller identified an enzyme in diatom species of Pseudo-nitzschia, termed MetDA here, which based on strong genetic associations with known DMSP enzymes is believed to be a novel initiating enzyme for the DMSP pathway. Cloning the MetDA gene into three vectors was attempted. Two constructs of the recombinant MetDA protein were successfully expressed in E. coli cells and purified using affinity column chromatography. A 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine assay was developed to characterize the deamination activity of MetDA. A perhaps promising result shows MetDA acts as a methionine deaminase with a NAD+ prosthetic group with an activity rate of 18.3 pmol per min per μg protein, which is in a similar range of other DMSP enzymes. This newly discovered enzyme gives metabolic engineers another option for genetic engineering of plants or bacteria to enhance their osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:54Z

Using thermodynamic models for the prediction of whether adsorption will occur is a potential path to identifying favourable systems quickly; however, these models require testing to determine whether they have applicability beyond the scope of the study for which they were created. A thermodynamic model is identified and used to screen oils for use in PEGylated-AuNP adsorption experiments. 1-Butanol was selected as the best candidate because of its good modelling results and positive initial performance, attributed to its low interfacial tension with water. Carboxylic acid-functionalized PEGylated AuNPs with 5 nm and 13 nm core sizes were synthesized and tested with different  concentrations of NaCl at different pHs to determine where adsorption to the interface was possible. AuNP films from systems comprised of NaCl concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.5 M at pH values of 4 and 8 were selected for study using atomic force microscopy. The results showed that the pH 8 systems at both NaCl concentrations formed monolayers at the interface.

they had considering dropping out, perceived less support from friends and family, and 
had lower self-efficacy scores than CGS. FGS reported motivations based on helping
family, and proving worth. CGS endorsed motivations based on expectations and 
encouragement from others. In regression analyses, predicting motivations, college-going 
self-efficacy was related to motivation for pursuing education post-bachelor's, and 
career/personal motivations, while students’ status was not. Higher levels of family and 
friend support was linked to more career/personal and encouragement motivations for 
FGS and CGS. For CGS only, support was correlated with higher humanitarian and fewer 
default motivations. Overall, this study demonstrated differences in the types of 
motivations between CGS and FGS. FGS’ lower self-efficacy and perception of fewer

Part of this decrease in abundance can be attributed to climate change as streams experience an increase in average summer temperatures and large daily thermal fluctuations. Prior studies have focused on evaluating the physiological response of Atlantic salmon by using stable laboratory-based settings. However, understanding the role of thermal variability on their physiology becomes increasingly important to properly predict their growth and performance in the wild. The objectives of my research were to understand how the growth and performance of parr from the
Restigouche River are affected by two different thermal profiles (16-21˚C vs. 19-24˚C) and to compare these responses to parr from the Miramichi River acclimated to the same conditions. After 4 weeks of acclimation to the two distinct thermal profiles, I began measuring length and weight of the fish every month to calculate the growth rate and condition factor. I also conducted a critical thermal maximum (CTmax) test to evaluate thermal tolerance, and an exhaustive swim test to measure swimming performance. I collected blood and tissue samples from control and exercised fish from each treatment to evaluate metabolite profiles. My results suggest that the growth rate was not different between thermal profiles within the Restigouche River, but was lower than the salmon from the Miramichi River. The CTmax was not affected by river origin, but increased in the warmer thermal profile. Moreover, time to exhaustion was not affected by thermal profiles, but it was higher in the Restigouche River. The results show that differences in growth and performance of parr from different river systems exist and this should be taken into account when developing new conservation strategies to maintain healthy populations.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:10Z

Findings demonstrated how disabled students' identities were informed by the neoliberal expectations and limitations placed on them by the university, and also revealed the ways in which participants were working to decenter and resist these norms. Though institutional policies and practices often separated disabled issues from the rest of the university environment, participants found community by resisting the expectation of remaining quiet about disability. A sense of community with other disabled students was discussed as a factor that positively influenced participant identities. By building community, participants resisted the isolation imposed upon them by the institution.

unexplored potential, with many studies aiming to define their signal transduction response, identify ligands, and determine their roles in diseases and disorders. Amino acids have become an

The aim of this study was to characterize the signal transduction response in multiple established signaling pathways for the L-phenylalanine - responsive GPCRs. This was investigated utilizing mammalian cells expressing a target GPCR and luciferase reporter for one of the Ga12/13, Gaq/11, Gbg, Gai/o, and Gas signaling pathways. Cells were treated with either L-phenylalanine or a control vehicle prior to luciferase assay examinations of their response. L-phenylalanine differentially activated GPCR signaling pathways, in a manner that was receptor-dependent, to preferentially increase or decrease cellular responses. Moreover, this response was not always limited to one preferential pathway, and not all receptors previously identified to be activated by L-phenylalanine were observed to significantly signal through the examined pathways. Elucidation of L-phenylalanine’s role in the regulation of cellular communication and function must be explored through independent receptor characterization due to its promiscuous receptor-dependent activation of GPCRs.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:54Z

This area aims to develop chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of substances hazardous to human health and the environment. Designing environmentally benign catalysts capable of performing redox reactions has been at the centre of Green Chemistry initiatives. Traditional catalysis is dominated by precious metals, such as palladium and platinum, due to their ability to achieve variable oxidation states and perform redox chemistry.  however, significant environmental concerns exist with their use and disposal. Indium could offer an appealing alternative to traditional precious metals due to its environmentally benign nature and tolerance
towards various functional groups. By incorporating a redox active ligand, the possibility to create a benign, base-metal-centered redox active catalyst exists. To this end, the objectives of this research project are to synthesize and characterize a series of molecular indium complexes incorporating a redox active amidobenzenethiolate (abt) ligand and test their redox capabilities through use of cyclic  voltammetry. The target compound MeIn(abt) (1) has been successfully synthesized via a hydrocarbon elimination reaction of Me3In and H2(abt) and spectroscopically characterized. Synthesis of organoindium reactants Ph3In and Mes3In has required modification of literature procedures, with the latter being successfully isolated in a yield of 47%. Significant progress has been made on the synthesis of MesIn(abt) (3). Further work is required in order to isolate crystals of target compounds for X-ray crystallography and

An expansionary fiscal policy such as a tax cut would boost the economy during recessions and drive up corporate profits. As corporate stock valuation is not only reflective of the corporation’s income, but more importantly a reflection of investors’ opinion on the corporation, a perceived boost in profit would have an impact on share value as well. This honours thesis focuses on the effects that a major tax cut would have on the stock valuation of American, and Canadian firms. It aims at exploring the stock market related consequences of a fiscal policy change by examining abnormal returns and abnormal volatility using an event study. Preliminary results show that abnormal returns rose for US corporations but fell for Canadian corporations on the day prior to the announcement of the tax cut, whereas abnormal volatility rose for both markets, with Canadian firms exhibiting much higher volatility compared to the US corporations.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

In all 3 treatment groups, ketone body production in the liver, circulating ketones in plasma, and ketone oxidation in cardiac and skeletal muscle will be measured to determine if there is a ketogenic response. In addition, cardiac muscle force production will be measured using either ketone bodies or glucose as a supplemental fuel to determine if ketone bodies can support force production in hearts from each treatment group.
I hypothesize that chronic hypoxia will elicit a ketogenic response in shortnose sturgeon. I predict that (1) ketone production in the liver will increase after being exposed to the hypoxic environment for 10 days in comparison to the starved group and (2) that there will be an increase ketolytic enzyme activity in the heart after the hypoxic exposure, which will help maintain cardiac contractility.

Hormonal mechanisms likely play a role, and both testosterone and cortisol have been demonstrated to alter cognition. The purpose of this study was to examine how testosterone and cortisol are related to decision making. Fortythree undergraduate students participated (30 women, 13 men, mean age = 19).
Participants provided a saliva sample immediately before completing two measures, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and the CRT-2. It was hypothesized that higher salivary testosterone levels would predict lower scores on the CRT and the CRT-2. Taking into account the dual-hormone hypothesis, it was hypothesized that the relationship between testosterone and cognitive reflection would be moderated by salivary cortisol, such that the relationship would not exist when cortisol levels were high. Testosterone was not correlated with CRT scores, but cortisol was negatively correlated with CRT scores for
men only. In a multiple regression analysis with testosterone, cortisol, and their interaction predicting CRT scores, the overall model was significant for men, but no individual variables predicted CRT scores. There was no relationship between hormones and CRT scores for women. Further research is needed to help clarify the impact of these hormones on decision making.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z

health outcomes compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers. Despite national and 
international recommendations for comprehensive and inclusive school-based sexual 
health education, research has shown inconsistencies and lack of gender and sexual
minority content in New Brunswick’s curricula. The current study examined if adult 
participants’ experiences of New Brunswick’s sexual health education within the last 10 
years included gender and sexual minority specific content and how perceptions of their
sexual health education correlated with attitudes toward gender and sexual minorities. A 
total of 623 participants who attended sexual health education in New Brunswick 
between grades 6 to 12 completed an online survey. The survey measured sources of 
sexual health education, perceived quality of sexual health education, and homophobia, 
biphobia, and transphobia. Participants of all identities and orientations reported low 
scores for the quality of their school-based sexual health education. Gender and sexual 
minority participants reported their education was not inclusive of their identities, which 
differed significantly from cisgender heterosexual participants’ experiences. 
Unexpectedly, higher perceived quality and inclusivity of school-based sexual health 
education significantly correlated with higher scores of homophobia, biphobia, and 
transphobia. However, since most people reported low quality, the education itself was 
inadequate, but those who perceived it as higher quality were more likely to endorse 
stigma against sexual and gender minorities. Overall, this study highlights opportunities 
to improve the explicit and comprehensive inclusion of gender and sexual minority 
content in New Brunswick’s sexual health education curricula",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:45Z

With the increasing use of nAg in consumer products, potential long-term effects on humans and the aquatic environment are a serious concern. This study looked to characterize the cardiac effects of nAg in brook trout. The nAg exposure through intravascular (I.V.) injection, 700μg/kg, resulted in a significant increase in both heart rate and blood pressure. There was also a decrease in Na+/K+ ATPase function seen in heart tissue. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase could have indirectly led to the decrease in Na+/Ca2+ exchange, increasing localized Ca2+ and thereby increasing contractility. The total
membrane ATPase was not affected, therefore the mechanism of this inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase is likely enzyme specific. in the nAg treatment groups, propranolol and atropine were not able to induce an effect on heart rate. This could be due to nAg binding to β-adrenergic, or cholinergic receptor sites prior to  harmacological intervention. These results indicate that nAg have a negative impact on cardiac function in brook trout, however further research is required to characterize the mechanism of toxicity.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:43Z

The two primary theories that address the formation of giant planets such as Jupiter, are Core Accretion (CA) and Disc Instability (DI). CA predicts that the core mass should be between 15 − 20E⊕, and DI predicts that the core mass should
be between 5 − 10E⊕. Since both predictions overlap with the current estimates, neither method can be confirmed as the one used to form Jupiter. Through Modules of Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), a series of models of Jupiter was created with changes in their core mass in 0.5E⊕ intervals within the current estimate. Using GYRE, a stellar oscillation code, the model’s p-modes and g-modes
were analyzed. Upon examination of p-modes, it was found that changes in the core had no significant effect on their oscillations per theoretical predictions. Several models exhibited irregular behaviours in their g-modes, showing higher than average percentage of frequencies with positive mode work and normalized growth rates (η). The physical characteristics of these irregular models were examined and found that the sound speed varied in regions less than 0.40 Jupiter radii. Additionally, period spacings of these models found the spacings to be regular and dips in the spacing, likely being caused by changes in the local molecular weight. Variations in regions of g-mode oscillations with core mass were found between 0.2 and 0.5 Jupiter radii, which further indicates that the core mass is affecting the g-mode oscillations and could be causing physical changes in the models. This research was not able to fully examine the exact differences in the interior structures that might be causing these irregular behaviours to occur but should be examined in the future. The results of this research remain inconclusive in  determining better estimations for the core mass of Jupiter but can act as a foundation for future  esearchers to continue.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:38Z

The media plays a significant role in creating and managing public opinion on issues of culture, race, gender, and citizenship, and thus is useful for analyzing immigrant representation while illustrating the prevalence of additional, theoretical borders.

Naturalism in the philosophy of mind—and in philosophy generally—covers quite a wide range of ideas and commitments. This thesis had its genesis in the problems that arise when we ask what it concretely means to hold a naturalistic position in the philosophy of mind. Given the differing conceptions of naturalism that are put forward in the philosophy of mind, we might ask what substantively differentiates a naturalistic position from a non-naturalistic one. To put it roughly, the purpose of this thesis is to inquire into what it means to operate in a naturalistic framework and to evaluate two broad trends I see in naturalistic frameworks put forward in the philosophy of mind.
This thesis has three chapters. In the first, I broadly outline and explicate the naturalistic frameworks of Galen Strawson and Daniel Dennett. Both claim to operate according to the dictates of naturalism but have radically different accounts of the mental (that is, the category that includes such things as ‘experience’, ‘belief’, ‘understanding’, etc.) and consciousness or experience (which I use interchangeably). This chapter serves to survey two, mutually exclusive approaches to and accounts of the mental. Its purpose is both to highlight some of the ways in which the mental is accounted for and to display the points of departure that lead to those accounts. It also serves to outline two distinct kinds of naturalism, what I will ultimately call liberal and restrictive naturalism, as described by Hillary Putnam and John McDowell, for example. In this chapter, I also introduce a number of problems in the philosophy of mind that I revisit in the subsequent chapters.
In Chapter 2, I critically analyze the positions put forward by Strawson and Dennett by evaluating the plausibility of panpsychism—which Strawson accepts—versus functionalism/behaviourism—which, in a special form to be discussed in this thesis, Dennett accepts. I characterize what I think a substantive naturalism consists in and then argue that panpsychism falls well within its range. I then argue, in part through considering a number of problems in the philosophy of mind (notably radical emergence and reductionism) that panpsychism provides the most felicitous framework for approaching and accounting for the mental. I also consider Dennett’s alternative proposal for  accounting for mental terms within a particular kind of materialist worldview, though I argue that it does not adequately deal with a number of concrete problems that arise.
In the last chapter, I characterize the two naturalistic systems of Strawson and Dennett in terms of liberal and restrictive naturalism, respectively, focusing on the former. Put  simply, liberal naturalists wish to maintain the integrity of the concepts in what Wilfrid Sellars called the ‘manifest image’: the concepts of the mental outlined (not exclusively) above. Restrictive naturalists do not handle these categories in a way that would satisfy the liberal naturalist, since their program, broadly speaking, is characterized by the effort to reduce the concepts of the space of reasons into the space of causes. I argue in favour of a liberal naturalist approach in the philosophy of mind and demonstrate that the kind of reductionism that is popular in the philosophy of mind is neither possible nor auspicious for our understanding of the mental. To this end, I also show how I think we might be able to take some of Strawson’s insights regarding panpsychism as a way to provide support for the idea that the concepts of the mental can be dealt with on their own merits rather than simply accounting for them behaviouristically. 
I would also like to express a brief word of thanks to the Department of Philosophy for their support over the last years. Special thanks also to my supervisor, Dr. Robbie Moser.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:44Z

Due to its long-standing criminal status, the limited existing research on cannabis has predominately explored addiction and the efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for various medical conditions, with a focus on young people. Nevertheless, statistics reveal an increase in cannabis use among older adults; therefore, it is important to explore what beliefs older adults possess that persuade or dissuade engagement with cannabis and to understand how they navigate their cannabis consumption. For the current study, data were collected from in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with six older adults. General thematic analysis was used for coding and theme development. The findings demonstrate that 1) participants relied upon disclosing their membership to particular social groups as a means of communicating their worldviews and engagement with cannabis; 2) participants perceived the risks of cannabis to be equivalent to, or less than that of alcohol, other illicit substances, and prescription medications; 3) they credited the government control as a result of legalization as a factor in reducing some of the risks related to cannabis; and 4) during the years of prohibition, the risk of informal sanctions played a more pivotal role than formal sanctions in affecting their consumption and the behaviours they exhibited. The whiteness of the participants leads to the question of how instrumental one’s race is in affecting the apprehension of formal sanctions surrounding cannabis for older adults. Thus, future research is needed to explore perceptions and behaviours of older adults surrounding cannabis, from an intersectional lens.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:00Z

Prochlorococcus belongs to the phylogenetically diverse functional group of photosynthetic picophytoplankton and is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on earth. In aquatic environments, phytoplankton, and specifically Prochlorococcus, metabolism represents a major source of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). If left un-scavenged ROS can have detrimental effects on marine phytoplankton growth and survival. Different Prochlorococcus strains grow stratified in marine aquatic environments from the surface to the bottom of the illuminated euphotic zone. Strains of Prochlorococcus at different depths exhibit diverse responses to light, however, they are slow growing and difficult to culture, with limited analyses of their growth responses. During this project I monitored growth trajectories of diverse Prochlorococcus strains across a matrix of light levels, light colors and oxygen levels. I found that each strain shows a distinct pattern of growth rates across the environmental matrices, with Prochlorococcus MED4 thriving under a high light, fully oxygenated niche; Prochlorococcus SS120 preferring a low light, oxygenated niche and Prochlorococcus MIT9313 preferring a low oxygen, high light niche. The combination of blue light and oxygenation is particularly stressful to Prochlorococcus MIT9313. We hypothesize that the oxygen intolerance of Prochlorococcus MIT9313 relates to strong sensitivity to ROS. Therefore, we took samples for subsequent analyses of cross linking of the major RbcL protein, a proxy for cumulative effects of ROS exposure. The results presented in this project can be applied to climate change research because it highlights the environmental responses of the foundational organism in marine food webs and bottom-up factors in ecosystem change within marine environments.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

Quels sont les enjeux de la collaboration littéraire ? Les collaborations sont souvent définies de la même manière, sans complexité, et la définition traditionnelle suggère surtout qu’il s’agit de travailler explicitement avec quelqu’un. Selon David Farkas, un critique littéraire qui s’intéresse aux stratégies collaboratives, il y a quatre façons de collaborer : deux ou plusieurs personnes qui travaillent ensemble sur un document ; deux ou plusieurs personnes qui contribuent à un document ; deux ou plusieurs personnes qui modifient un document ; et une personne qui crée un document avec quelqu’un d’autre en utilisant ses idées (Hill 3). La majorité de ces définitions se comparent à la définition conventionnelle de la collaboration selon le dictionnaire Larousse : « Action de collaborer [c’est-à-dire de travailler en commun], de participer à une oeuvre avec d’autres ».
Dans le monde littéraire, il y a de nombreux exemples de collaboration qui s’alignent avec les définitions conventionnelles déjà soulignées. Dans l’écriture des femmes au Canada, considérons, par exemple, L’été avant la mort qui est le fruit d’une collaboration entre France Daigle et Hélène Harbec. Ces deux écrivaines ont travaillé ensemble en partageant la tâche d’écriture ; la voix de chacune est bien présente dans l’oeuvre (Les Éditions du Remue-Ménage, 1986). En littérature populaire, le roman State of Terror de Hillary Clinton et l’auteure canadienne Louise Penny est aussi un exemple assez typique d’un projet d’écriture collaboratif entre deux amies lequel illustre le rôle de l’amitié dans la collaboration (Simon & Schuster, 2021). Momo et Loulou de Mona Latif-Ghattas et Louise Desjardins est encore un autre exemple de collaboration littéraire dans le contexte canadien (Les Éditions du Remue-Ménage, 2004). Cette oeuvre traite de l’enfance des deux auteures dans les années 1950 dans deux pays différents : L’Égypte et le Canada. L’amitié des deux écrivaines a influencé la rédaction de Momo et Loulou, parce qu’elles ont décidé d’organiser la structure de l’oeuvre comme un échange de courriels pour raconter leurs souvenirs d’enfance dans leurs pays d’origine.
Mais peut-on élargir cette définition de « collaboration » ? Plus précisément, les collaborations créatives entre femmes peuvent-elles faire partie d’une autre définition de collaboration ou même générer une nouvelle définition ? Susan Rudy, auteure de l’article « Women Who Invite Collaboration », se concentre sur les collaborations littéraires non conventionnelles entre femmes avec le but de reconstruire ou renouveler la définition de collaborations et d’explorer ce qui peut être catégorisé comme « collaboratif ». Rudy construit ses arguments à l’aide d’autres sources secondaires et de plusieurs exemples littéraires ; elle propose qu’il y ait une variété de collaborations atypiques dans l’écriture des femmes au Canada. Elle suggère notamment qu’il ne faut pas avoir deux auteures inscrites dans une oeuvre pour que cela puisse être considéré comme un projet collaboratif (Rudy 24). Elle affirme aussi que les lectrices peuvent faire partie du processus collaboratif en étant invitées à collaborer implicitement par l’auteure. Selon Rudy, un individu peut même collaborer avec un quelqu’un de décédé (28). Ces idées démontrent qu’il y a amplement à découvrir sur les nombreuses formes de collaboration littéraire des femmes.
De même, Lorraine York, une historienne littéraire, soutient les idées de Rudy et examine elle-même le processus collaboratif typique dans l’oeuvre Rethinking Women’s Collaborative Writing. Selon York, il n’y a pas une seule façon de définir la collaboration parce qu’elle peut être menée de façons variées. Soulignant l’histoire des collaborations entre femmes, York suggère que les exemples historiques montrent déjà une perspective plus large (6). Un exemple intéressant qu’elle analyse est le texte Educate, Organize, and Agitate : A Historical Overview of Feminist Collaboration in Great Britain and America de Melodie Andrews, une auteure qui se penche sur les mouvements collaboratifs entre femmes. Andrews examine les collaborations entre femmes anglaises de classe moyenne dans le 19e siècle et elle propose que ces collaborations fussent activées par l’amitié. C’est l’amitié qui permettait aux femmes de trouver une identité collaborative ainsi qu’une solidarité nécessaire pour la collaboration (York 6). Ces idées s’alignent avec les caractéristiques de la collaboration identifiées par Rudy dans « Women Who Invite Collaboration ». Comme York, Rudy soutient que l’amitié est un élément intégral de l’acte collaboratif (23).
Pour voir comment ces éléments de la collaboration — ses formes multiples et son rapport à l’amitié entre femmes — se manifestent dans divers écrits récents de femmes au Canada français, nous nous pencherons sur trois oeuvres fort différentes. En premier lieu, nous étudierons l’essai « Châtoyants, les morceaux de soi » de Marilou Craft et Chloé Savoie-Bernard, dans l’ouvrage collectif Se faire éclaté.e expériences marginales et écritures de soi et un autre essai écrit par ces deux femmes intitulé « Dans l’ordre et le désordre du secret » publié dans la revue Percées — Explorations en arts vivants. Craft et Savoie-Bernard créent une performance qui reflète une variété d’aspects de leur vie et de leurs expériences en tant que femmes noires artistes, ce qui permet une vaste exploration de formes collaboratives atypiques grâce à l’identité, aux expériences partagées et à la liaison de ces deux femmes par leurs créations artistiques ainsi que par les choix lexicaux. Cette analyse permettra de tenir compte de la notion de « connivence » de Nicole Brossard et son rôle dans le processus collaboratif.
Ensuite, on analysera Je veux une maison faite de sorties de secours, un ouvrage collectif édité par Claudia Larochelle et composé d’essais, de lettres et d’illustrations de plusieurs écrivains et critiques, dont Larochelle. Ce volume est un hommage à Nelly Arcan édité par une ancienne amie de l’écrivaine décédée, ce qui nous donnera l’occasion d’explorer les façons variées dont on peut collaborer avec quelqu’un de décédé. On examinera également le lien entre l’amitié et la collaboration. Ce texte permettra ainsi une analyse du croisement entre les critiques et les relations intimes tout en considérant ce que cela apporte à la question de la collaboration.
En dernier lieu, on étudiera Les villes de papier de Dominique Fortier. Cette oeuvre hybride entremêle les expériences de Fortier et celles de Dickinson imaginées par Fortier. Elle inclut aussi les poèmes de Dickinson dans l’oeuvre. On considéra donc le rôle des formes d’intertextualités et de l’écriture créative dans la collaboration en touchant sur les façons dont on peut collaborer avec un individu qu’on n’a pas connu et créer un lien avec cette personne.
Les trois oeuvres littéraires qu’on analysera dans ce mémoire ont été choisies parce qu’elles représentent les formes de collaborations atypiques et elles contribuent au développement d’une nouvelle définition de la collaboration. Les idées de Rudy et York introduisent de nouvelles approches hors de la norme qui permettent une exploration des techniques collaboratives incluses dans la littérature contemporaine des femmes. Ainsi, à l’aide des théories de Rudy et York, ce mémoire explorera des approches novatrices aux formes de collaborations utilisées dans de nombreuses oeuvres littéraires du Canada français rédigées par des femmes. Cette analyse autorisera aussi une compréhension du processus créatif et collaboratif des femmes auteures du Canada dans la rédaction littéraire. De plus, les textes de Craft et Savoie-Bernard, comme ceux de Larochelle et Arcan, permettront de voir en quoi l’amitié nourrit la collaboration. Pour sa part, la collaboration de Fortier et Dickinson aidera à voir jusqu’à quel point la collaboration peut créer une solidarité entre les générations. Finalement, cette étude permettra d’affirmer les liens diachroniques et synchroniques entre les écrits de femmes.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:14Z

In the aquatic environment, AgNPs aggregate and fall to the bottom, affecting benthic creatures. In this study, the Bristlenose Catfish (Ancistrus Cirrhosis) was used for their benthic nature and their ability to air breathe using their highly vascularized stomachs. By analyzing air breathing frequency (seen only in times of stress), we can better understand what role AgNPs play in a catfish’s ability to tolerate environmental stress. Experimentation was done by isolating catfish for seven days with the absence or presence of AgNPs. On the eighth day, these fish were exposed to one of three environmental conditions: control (optimal conditions), hypoxia (20% O2 saturation), and high temperature (32°C). These fish then had their movement tracked and quantified over 6 hours. In addition to this, fish were placed in a respirometer to measure oxygen consumption, gills were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy, and gut samples were used to determine malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. It was found that fish regardless of environmental stressor or AgNP presence total distance moved did not change. However, hypoxic fish exposed to AgNPs were found to increase air breathing frequency. This indicates that any movement the catfish is doing is focused on air breathing, which could increase their exposure to aerial predators. Respirometry analysis showed an increase
in oxygen consumption only when AgNPs are present, which is in keeping with behavioral data, since an increase in basal oxygen consumption would lead to a higher air breathing frequency. MDA levels varied between environmental stressors in AgNP exposed fish, but qualitative gill analysis indicated that the gills were not damaged from nanoparticles. Together, these results support our hypotheses that AgNPs do interfere with a catfish’s ability to tolerate environmental stress. It is expected that with an increase in concentration or exposure times, these effects would increase proportionally.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:51Z

completed an online survey that assessed participants eating disorder behaviour (EAT26), 
behaviours consistent with the Adonis Complex (ACQ) and perceived social support
(modified MPSS). The results revealed significant differences in eating disorder 
behaviour between female and male athletes, with females scoring significantly higher. 
No differences were found between how female and male athletes scored on the Adonis 
Complex Questionnaire. Significant differences were found between lean-sport and non 
lean sport athletes, with lean sport athletes exhibiting more eating disorder behaviours. 
Furthermore, non-lean sport male athletes were found to score significantly higher than 
lean-sport male athletes for the Adonis Complex. Significant differences were also found 
across club and varsity sports, with club athletes exhibiting significantly more eating 
disorder behaviours than varsity athletes. Perceived social support was found to be 
negatively correlated to eating disorder behaviour, and when considering gender 
variables, level of competition and type of sport, accounted for unique variance in eating 
disorder behaviour. These results suggest that athletes are susceptible to negative mental
health outcomes, and eating behaviours vary among athletes and sport type. The results 
highlight the importance of having support systems in place for student athletes and
increasing awareness of athletic staff and coaches as to the seriousness and prevalence of 
eating disorder behaviours among their student athletes",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:48Z

Other neurotransmitters, like endocannabinoids (eCBs) and nitric oxide (NO), have been shown to modulate anxiety-like behaviours; however, the mechanisms regarding how eCBs and NO affect anxiety in youth remains unclear. Many studies have highlighted the importance of the eCB anandamide in the modulation of anxiety and the stress response. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further investigate eCBs, specifically anandamide, and NO in young rats. We hypothesized that anandamide will modulate anxious behaviours in a CB1 receptor and NO dependent manner. In order to investigate this hypothesis, young male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of the following treatment groups: 1) vehicle (saline), 2) URB597 (fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor), 3) vehicle (30-minute restraint), 4) URB597 (30-minute restraint), 5) L-NAME (blocks NO synthesis, 30-minute restraint), 6) URB597 + L-NAME (30-minute restraint), 7) SR141716 + URB597 (cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, 30-minute restraint), and their anxiety was tested using the elevated plus-maze. There were no statistically significant differences observed between nonstressed experimental groups (vehicle and URB597). Administration of URB597 prior to acute stress significantly decreased open arm time in the maze, reflecting anxiogenic behaviour. In the presence of the CB1 receptor antagonist or the NO synthesis blocker, URB597 significantly increased anxious behaviours. These findings suggest that anandamide may have anxiogenic-like effects following acute stress in which CB1 receptors and NO does not play a role.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:25Z

Mercury is a toxic trace element of primary concern; elevated concentrations can have adverse impacts on bird health. The extent to which shorebirds that use the western Atlantic flyway during their southbound migration carry mercury while at migratory staging areas within Atlantic Canada is relatively unknown. Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) and Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) are Arctic-breeding migratory shorebirds that use Atlantic Canada as a staging ground during southbound migration. We captured juveniles of these two species at Petit-Cap, NB, and collected blood and feathers for mercury analysis. We also recorded body mass and structural size to estimate relative fuel loads and analyzed feather isotopes to estimate breeding origin. Mercury concentrations in blood reflect recent dietary exposure or mobilization from storage tissues, while feathers reflect mercury present in the body at the time of feather growth, which for birds in our study was their natal site. Blood mercury concentrations declined with increased relative fuel loads in Semipalmated Sandpipers, but there was no relationship for Semipalmated Plovers. Further, Semipalmated Sandpipers had significantly higher blood mercury concentrations than Semipalmated Plovers, though concentrations in both species were below those associated with toxic effects. Alternatively, some feather mercury concentrations were above those associated with toxic effects. Feather mercury concentrations in Semipalmated Sandpipers originating from more eastern and southern breeding areas were higher than in birds breeding farther west, suggesting variable exposure on the breeding grounds. Our results highlight the variation in mercury burdens within birds that use the western Atlantic flyway. ",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:45Z

Building on past research, results also showed that selfcompassion was associated with low stress which, in turn, was associated with lower burnout. Although self-compassion was not directly related to job satisfaction, the
results highlight the need for researchers to examine the role of self-compassion in populations beyond the healthcare sector. In addition to replicating the present findings,

years, and as a result has been exploring a variety of different solutions to resist these shortfalls. 
Population growth remains a significant focus for the province to accommodate for many of these 
issues, predominantly through immigration; the underlying effects and indirect consequences of
these strategies remain unresearched. This thesis thus consists of a critical analysis of three 
documents using a Bourdieusian theoretical framework: the New Brunswick Population Growth 
Strategy (2019-2024), the New Brunswick Express Entry Stream, and the New Brunswick Skilled 
Worker Stream, to see how well these programs align with what is offered by the New Brunswick 
government for supports and consider if or how these programs encourage retention in the 
province. Findings indicate an indirectly exclusive economic immigrant that adheres to a variety 
of neoliberal principles, and simultaneously enforce patriarchal, geopolitical, and racial hierarchies 
through many of these credentials. Findings also indicate a privatized, economically driven, and 
short-term model of immigration and population growth, that lacks consideration of the long 
researched barriers to successful integration within communities. Lastly, the province utilizes the 
existing inequities within economic immigration programs to promote short-term contributions to 
the province’s economy without equal support that citizens and Permv anent Residents may access. 
This thesis concludes with reflections on how to improve these strategies with a long-term 
approach to population growth and retention",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:08Z

These narratives are divided into five categories: language barriers, stereotypes, a sense of belonging, cultural education, and self-advocacy. The study contributes to our understanding of the implications of the absence of minority culture in education. Education is critical for the Central American population to increase opportunities for employment in Canada, and to facilitate access to other institutions and services. The Toronto District School Board’s census portraits help to indicate the role of each stakeholder (parents, students, and teachers) in how they engage with education in Toronto in order to contextualize their cultural uniqueness. Secondly, Critical Pedagogy and Critical Race Theory suggest how Eurocentric curriculum can be challenged and replaced with less culturally biased curriculum through narrative engagement. Lastly, through the interviews, research participants address a lack of representation of the Central American population in education and the danger of marginalization. Overall, this study suggests how inclusive education will meet with only limited success if the learning approach does not encourage minority students’ voices to address the lack of culturally diverse curriculum and raise the impact of student-centred learning.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:14Z

Generally, weight gain is a result of a prolonged imbalance of food intake and energy expenditure. Further investigation of pathways affecting appetite regulation is required to develop safer, effective treatments for obesity. Two signals of interest are endocannabinoids (eCBs) and nitric oxide (NO), which have been shown to regulate food intake in adult animals. Research in young animals is limited, but it has been suggested that these neurotransmitters have different age-dependent effects on appetite in rats fed a standard diet. The current investigation was undertaken in fasted and non-fasted rats fed a high-fat diet, to gain insight into the effect of inhibiting or exciting eCB and NO pathways on palatable food consumption. In the first condition, young Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted for 24 hours, assigned randomly to a drug treatment or control group, and were refed for a 2-hour period, after which they were sacrificed and perfused. Food consumption data and accompanying body weight data were collected from each trial. In fasted animals, inhibiting the production of nitric oxide was shown to significantly reduce food intake and body weight, and blocking cannabinoid receptors also resulted in a significant decrease in food consumption compared to a control group receiving saline injections. In subsequent trials in non-fasted animals, blocking cannabinoid receptors resulted in a significant decrease in body weight compared to
control animals. Results demonstrated that the manipulation of eCB and NO pathways in young rats fed a high-fat diet differed in their effects when compared to standard diet fed animals. These results confirm that further investigation is needed in non-fasted animals, as well as animals chronically exposed to a high-fat diet, to understand the physiological response of these pathways to drug interference.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:49Z

However, the mechanism by which this bacterium modulates these changes remains unknown. There are 3 distinct epigenetic mechanisms, histone modification, non-coding RNA regulation and DNA methylation, each of which alter gene expression through chromatin modification rather than changes in the genetic code itself. Epigenetics in the I. scapularis is relatively understudied, with little to no current research on DNA methylation specifically. Presently, it is unknown if DNA methylation changes or remains the same in the presence of B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, epigenetics has yet to be explored as the possible cause for the physiological changes in Ixodes scapularis, in response to infection by B. burgdorferi. In this study, the DNA methylation status of the pericentromeric tandem repeats family, Ixodes scapularis Repeats (ISR), in Borrelia-infected and non-infected I. scapularis samples was investigated. This was done through performing methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation reactions on I. scapularis DNA extracts of either infection status. DNA methylation status was quantified through a qPCR analysis involving the immunoprecipitated DNA, and primers targeting each ISR region. Calculations found that when comparing the ISR2A, ISR2D and ISR3 regions, overall significantly more DNA methylation was measured in the Borrelia-infected samples (p = 0.0129,
n=3). The same trend was observed when targeting the ISR2B and ISR2C regions (n=1). Additionally, the ISR regions were found to be differentially methylated, with the ISR2A (p = 0005838, n=3) and the ISR3 (p = 0000833, n=3) regions experiencing significantly more DNA methylation than the ISR2D region. The ISRC region was also found to be more heavily methylated than the ISR2B region (n=1). This study found novel evidence that DNA methylation in I. scapularis may be responsive and modulated by the presence of B. burgdorferi. Additionally, it was demonstrated that distinct genomic regions can differ in their epigenetic responsiveness, and that the ISR2A, ISR2C and ISR3 may act as epigenetic markers in this organism. These results provide the groundwork for future epigenetic studies of the I. scapularis in relation to B. burgdorferi.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:22Z

Thus, it may be challenging to professionally care for them and/or their families. Focusing on the city of Miramichi (New Brunswick) first-line workers [i.e., police officers and youth workers, including social workers and independent living program (ILP) coaches], this study investigated: (1) their perceptions of the psychosocial needs of YDB; (2) the potential barriers and facilitators in their daily work; and (3) awareness of existing NB services for YDB. This study used qualitative, semi-structured, telephone interviews with eight first-line workers. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The analysis was divided into five general categories: general youth needs, risk and protective factors for youth, barriers for first-line workers in daily work with YDB, facilitators of daily work for first-line workers om daily work with YDB, and front-line workers’ awareness of services in NB. First, the investigation of youth needs in general generated five key themes: (1) lack of achievement and employment, (2) harmful behaviours, (3) mental health and drug abuse, (4) negative relationships, and (5) varying outcomes for YDB. Second, data related to risk factors and protective factors for these youth generated three main themes: (1) prosocial relationships and stable home life (2) sufficient services (3) completion of school and attainment of a job. Such results were consistent with the literature on youth disruptive behaviour disorders (YD). Third, five major themes presented in the data reflecting barriers in the daily work of first-line workers’: (1) The individual youth (2) the emotional nature of the job (3) insufficient services for youth (4) other individuals in the lives of youth (5) minimal barriers among police. Next, the most prominent facilitators in their daily work consisted of: (1) support for youth and (2) support for workers. Finally, when examining Miramichi first-line workers’ awareness of existing NB services, two themes emerged: (1) greater knowledge with greater experience and (2) exclusive awareness of Navicare/SoinsNavi by youth workers. This research indicates gaps in existing services and service delivery for youth within the city of Miramichi.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:46Z

Although Marx uses the term revolution, there are many places in his work where he clarifies that he is referring to social revolution, not political revolution. The following sections will illustrate what Marx says on this subject by examining several of his works and by using textual evidence to determine his true opinion and philosophy on this issue.

The aim of this research is to gain a better understanding of those stars' behaviours through an expansion of the findings of Lovekin and Guzik, which found a strong correlation between Delta Scuti stars' pulsation constant (Q) as a function of effective temperature and the amount of convective overshoot within the star. However, only models with metallicities of Z = 0.02 were examined, prompting the question of if this relation is dependent on chemical composition. I collected the data in this research through creation of a grid of stellar models using the open-source coding language MESA, and analyzed the models pulsation properties using the complementary coding language GYRE. By varying the models mass, rotation speed, convective overshoot, and metallicity it was determined that the relationship found by Lovekin and Guzik does hold for stars of other metal compositions and may have a quantifiable metallicity dependence, although statistically weak. In addition, a second relation between Q as a function of effective temperature and convective overshoot was discovered at higher effective temperatures as well. The cause of this new relation was found to be due to the deepest surface convection zone depth of the models.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:00Z

They are responsible for senses including smell, sight and taste, in addition to internal metabolite sensing. GPCRs are excellent drug targets due to the important role they play in a variety of physiological processes; over 34% of all FDA approved drugs target GPCRs. Orphan GPCRs are a subset of approximately 90 GPCRs which do not have an established endogenous or exogenous ligand. Artificial sweeteners are a family of organic compounds which activate the GPCR taste receptor (T1R2/T1R3) but are not metabolized by the human body leading to the initial belief that they are safe and effective sugar replacements which reduce caloric consumption. However, recent findings suggest that chronic artificial sweetener consumption may lead to glucose intolerance and metabolic disease and that unknown receptors beyond T1R2/T1R3 are capable of sensing sweet molecules. In this study, 72 family A orphan GPCRs were screened for activation through treatment with a combination of the artificial sweeteners sucralose and saccharin using the PRESTO-Tango resource for GPCR interrogation. The strength of activation in identified receptor candidates was investigated further with both natural and artificial sweeteners. Two receptors were found to be significantly activated by the artificial sweeteners, GPR17 and GPR52, which is the first report of this receptor-agonist pairing. Dose response curves revealed that artificial sweetener activated GPR17 signalling was saturated at a concentration of 2 mM with a 1.5-fold change response for saccharin and a 1.6-fold change response for sucralose relative to control. GPR17 activation was higher for the sucrose treatment with a fold change of 2.1. Conversely, GPR52 responded more strongly to artificial sweeteners with a greater than 5-fold change in receptor activation when treated by sucralose or saccharin but was not activated by sucrose. These findings suggest that these orphan receptors may play a wider role in human metabolism than has been previously considered.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:08Z

In addition, there is evidence to support an association between vocabulary and general reading level. The present study explored whether adding elaborative semantic teaching to storybook readings increased vocabulary learning and whether storybook exposure helps children learn to read the words to which they are being exposed. This study directly evaluated oral vocabulary learning and initial learning to read of novel words embedded within storybook contexts. Fifty-nine kindergarten students listened to two storybooks, in which ten nonwords were embedded in each. The nonwords were presented in two conditions: dialogic reading with semantic elaboration and dialogic reading without extra semantic focus. After a delay, students were tested on their ability to recognize, identify, understand, and read the nonwords that were presented in the storybook, relative to control nonwords. Posttests included receptive and expressive measures of vocabulary breadth and depth, as well as a novel learn-to-read task involving the embedded target nonwords. The results highlight the impact of storybook reading on word learning, particularly when presented with semantics. Participants demonstrated a greater degree of knowledge for the nonwords that were presented with additional semantics. In contrast, semantics provided no benefit in the learn-to-read task. Yet children demonstrated superior performance on the learn to read task for the nonwords from both conditions that were embedded in the storybooks compared to control nonwords that were not in the storybooks.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:46Z

Stress was measured using the self-report measures of perceived stress and daily stress. The dot probe task erotic images, angry faces (threat stimuli), and neutral stimuli were used in the dot probe task. Results showed that there was a positive relationship between perceived stress and sexual desire, but there were no associations between stress and response bias towards either threat or erotic stimuli.

and wheel run in the other component on a mult FR 15 FR 15 schedule of reinforcement. 
To assess positive contrast in wheel running, lever-pressing behavior was put under 
extinction and vice versa. Increases in lever-pressing and wheel-running rates under the 
contrast condition were consistent with previously observed positive contrast effects.
Results showed a significantly larger increase with contrast and decrease with extinction 
for lever pressing effect, relative to wheel running. Similarly, post einforcement pause 
(PRP) duration increased substantively with extinction and decreased markedly with 
contrast for lever pressing. In comparison, for wheel running, PRP duration decreased 
with extinction and did not change with contrast. These differences can be attributed to 
the automatic reinforcement that wheel-running manifests, but lever pressing does not. 
These findings were also the first to show a positive contrast effect using wheel running 
as an operant behavior.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:14Z

The peptide is proven to be a successful coagulation reagent, however the viscous characteristics that encompass the peptide present many analytical challenges. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, (LCMS), Vn96 was analyzed using three different mass spectrometers; a triple quadrupole, a linear quadrupole ion trap, and a quadrupole orbitrap. An extensive understanding of each instrument was done to determine the best settings for the characterization of Vn96. It is shown that the calibration curve for Vn96 produces a non-zero intercept. During the analysis of Vn96 it was determined that adsorption was occurring at concentrations below 5ug/mL resulting in inconsistent data received by the LCMS. It was determined that use of low bind sample vials is required to eliminate Vn96 from adhering to sample vial walls. Additionally, 20% acetonitrile (ACN) and 1.8M sodium chloride (NaCl) is observed to significantly increase signal intensity of Vn96. The lowest concentration of Vn96 detectable using ethyl acetate and sodium chloride is 10ng/mL.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:48Z

Twenty-two recommendations for improving student performance and educational outcomes were outlined in the official document, Raise the Bar. Dr. Glaze’s recommendations were rooted in efficiency, austerity, and improving accountability. Soon after, Nova Scotia passed the Education Reform Act, officially adopting almost all of the recommendations Dr. Glaze provided. Many sweeping changes to education and administration have resulted, such as the removal of school boards. During the implementation of Dr. Glaze’s recommendations, the impacts on equitable education outcomes have been felt across many stakeholders including teachers and students. This analysis considers the conditions that led to Dr. Glaze’s review to assess if equitable education outcomes are achievable now, four years after Raise the Bar. Examining who benefits from education reform rollouts (and why), this thesis argues that changes to education are necessary for equitable educational outcomes but cannot be
meaningfully implemented as a neoliberal project.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:54Z

Further, would additional teaching for vocabulary depth and/or invented spelling be beneficial? These are the primary goals of the present study. Fifty-nine kindergarten students were recruited from a local elementary school to participate in a pretest, intervention, and posttest experimental design. They were exposed to 10 nonwords in a storybook, then completed word learning and learn-to-read tasks. Invented spelling was a between-participant variable, semantic enrichment within-participant. Participants correctly identified the nonwords presented in the storybook, showing vocabulary learning via storybook exposure. Extra semantic enrichment improved word learning on tasks measuring semantic depth (i.e., comparison and definition tasks). The participants were then administered a learn-to-read task, and the results showed increased learning across trials; a benefit of word exposure (control words significantly lower); an interaction between spelling and semantic enrichment- indicating a significant advantage provided by extra semantic teaching in the group that did not also spell the words. In sum, this study demonstrates that vocabulary links to learning to read on a word-specific basis, and both spelling practice and semantic enrichment further contribute to learning to read- although their beneficial effects do not appear to be additive at this early age.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:03Z

The aim of my study was to examine and compare the quality of ultrasonic images captured in different media and resolutions of the ultrasound (US). My overall objective is to help develop protocols to obtain the highest quality ultrasonic images when viewing the internal structures of a fish. The gonad images of Blue Tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) and Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) were captured in different media (water and gel/air), transducer probe orientation (frontal and Transverse) and placement (lateral and ventral). All images were analysed objectively using the rectangle tool on Fiji/image J to outline region of interest and conducted a fractal analysis “fraclac” in Fiji to generate fractal values that were test statistically using MANOVA.RM and subjectively using a blind survey and reporting my observations. Objectively for Blue Tilapia sample, media and resolution significantly influenced image quality (p=<0.001). For media, water and gel were significantly different (p=0). For resolution, High resolution RES) and general resolution (GEN) were significantly different (p<0.001). Supplementary work was done on shortnose sturgeons, in the two different media (water and gel/air) with only general resolution (GEN). Objective analysis for the shortnose sturgeon sample images shows no detectable difference between media (p=0.796). For the subjective approach, forest plots were made to measure heterogeneity of survey responses. For the blue tilapia survey, participants viewed the highest quality image as those captured in water at high resolution (RES). For shortnose sturgeon survey, participants viewed the highest quality image as those captured in gel/air at general resolution (GEN). Based on my observations, there was no relationship between image quality and mean gray values for both blue tilapia and shortnose sturgeon images. This study was conducted using a single ultrasound (Sonosite Edge II). Thus, different results can be obtained using a different ultrasound (US) machine.

social norms, develops during the preschool years. In addition, children refine prosocial
behaviours during this time. While hot and cool executive function (EF) abilities have
been explored as independent systems, few studies have investigated the impact of their
interaction on more complex cognitive abilities. Therefore, the current study examined
the effects of both hot and cool EF on preschool children’s sharing behaviours after
viewing an Ultimatum-style norm paradigm. The sample consisted of 101 three- and
four-year-old children (M = 3.58 years, SD = 0.50) including 55 females and 46 males
from daycares in rural New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. Participants completed
a number of tests of EF including working memory, inhibitory control, as well as a
version of the Preschool Gambling task. Participants also completed a task to assess
social norm learning which included three phases: baseline sharing, norm learning, and
post-manipulation sharing. Whether children observed a generous or stingy model of sharing did not influence subsequent sharing behaviour on its own. Rather, a cluster analysis resulting in three distinct groups differing on baseline sharing and rejection rates suggested that individual differences may be more important in determining sharing behaviours. Moreover, the findings suggest that a balanced combination of both hot and cool EF abilities are necessary for understanding and complying to social norms. The findings of this study will help to inform the field about the early processes which underlie social norm learning, and more broadly, prosocial development.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:59Z

contaminants into the environment through tailings that were transported by wind and surface 
waters. I investigated the remains of benthic invertebrates and geochemical proxies archived in 
the sediment of a shallow lake downstream from the province’s most productive historical gold 
mine. Sedimentary concentrations of metal(loid)s were used to determine mining inputs of 
tailings as well as establish the pre-mining and post-mining time periods within the lake 
sediment record. Chironomid assemblages were assessed as an ecological response to long-term 
environmental changes. Total mercury levels peaked at six times above the sediment quality 
guidelines, and arsenic concentrations peaked at 165 times. Sedimentary contaminants have 
declined but remain above probable effect levels. There was a significant difference (p = 0.001) 
in assemblage compositions between the pre-mining and post-mining time periods. There were 
seven indicator taxa in the pre-mining and three indicator taxa in the post-mining period. In the 
pre-mining time period, there was an average of 1448 ± 186 chironomid head capsules per gram 
of sediment which declined to an average of 355 ± 257 per gram in the post-mining time period. 
The relative abundances of several metal(loid) tolerant chironomid taxa have increased in the 
post-mining period. For example, during the pre-mining period Constempellina was present at an 
average of 5% abundance and increased to 12% abundance post-mining. Findings from this 
study show that pollution from historical gold mining continues to make its way into and 
negatively affect the benthos of Gegogan Lake",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:03Z

Size and age are known to impact larval vulnerability to predation, but how they do so have been debated. The bigger-is-better hypothesis that proposed large larvae have fitness advantages over their smaller counterparts has come under scrutiny as most studies that support this hypothesis only consider proxies for probability of capture. A less explored hypothesis suggests that the benefits of size vary with each day, where it could be beneficial to be small or large depending on external conditions. This study seeks to expand on this hypothesis by exploring the effects of size and age on proxies of probability of encounter and probability of capture during the yolk sac stage of zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio). Direct yolk sac manipulation attempted to create larvae of distinct size groups at hatch, but it was found unsuccessful as the control and reduction groups were not significantly different at hatch (p = 0.878). Instead, larvae were split into large and small groups from the top and bottom 25% from standard length that varied in size from 8 to 22. Probability of encounter was estimated from free swimming trials which measured distance travelled (mm) and mean velocity (mm/s). Probability of encounter was estimated from escape response experiments, where larvae experienced a tactile stimulation. It was found that large larvae moved significantly further distances on day 4 (p = 0.00835), and significantly faster on day 3 (p = 0.00813). Escape response was measured as distance travelled (mm), mean velocity (mm/s), max acceleration (mm2/s), and latency to respond. It was found that small larvae travelled significantly further on day 2 (p = 0.00216), but large larvae responded quicker to a threat than small larvae on day 2 (p = 0.00399). The estimates of probability of encounter and probability of capture in this study do not indicate that age or size effect the vulnerability to predation of yolk sac zebrafish larvae. This suggests small larvae are not at a fitness disadvantage to large cohort members, potentially providing the beginning steps to a counter argument of the bigger-is-better hypothesis.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is one such brain region, and although it is a majorsite of insulin receptors, virtually nothing is known about the effect of insulin on neuronal activity and communication between DMHneurons. Since DMHneuronsstimulate appetite and insulin is a satiety hormone, I hypothesized that insulin inhibits both neuronal activity and neuronal communication in the DMH.Iusedwhole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to record from living DMH neurons taken from young male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. I compared recordings before and after applying 500 nM of insulin (Labouèbe et al., 2013) to determine the effect of insulin on action potentials (a measureofneuronalexcitability) and excitatory synaptic transmission (a measure of neuronal communication). Insulin significantly decreased action potential frequency and excitatory current amplitudes in both sexes, indicating that insulin decreases neuronal excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission in the DMH. Recordings taken with various insulin receptor blockers present suggested that insulin binds to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors. Insulin signalling in the DMH is also independent of feeding state, suggesting that it is involved with regulating physiological processes beyond appetite regulation.

first overtone. However, a small but significant minority appear to display a frequency 
modulated with a higher overtone. There is no currently accepted hypothesis as to why. 
This research project used a combination of software suites to simulate stellar evolution, 
and energy, density, and material flow within the star. A 7 solar mass model began 
displaying clear pulsation, and Fourier analysis of the luminosity data also suggests higher 
overtones are present. This model also displays gravity waves and spherical harmonics

A qualitative analysis was conducted on the contents of the interviews. Three major themes emerged: neoliberal organization, community accountability, and transformative practices. In the following chapters, these themes are analyzed in correspondence with existing literature, which draws from the works of scholars and organizers such as Angela Davis, Paulo Freire, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Mariame Kaba. Additionally, the research also references studies on other social movements, including the Zapatista Movement, the Maple Spring protests, the Sir George Williams University student uprisings, and the fossil fuel divestment movement.

Consequently, spelling accuracy has been shown to directly relate to reading speed, as spelling accuracy reflects lexical quality. Here, 75 undergraduate students spelled 25 words over three attempts to determine spelling accuracy, and then read these same words aloud, and their reading times were recorded. In support of the LQH, words with low and intermediate spelling accuracy were read significantly slower than words with high spelling accuracy. The location of first spelling errors and the number of spelling errors within misspelled words were also evaluated in relation to reading speed. Words with errors located in the first half were read significantly slower than words with errors located in the second half of the word. This supports scanning theory and the cohort model- which suggest that we store and retrieve words from left to right, and process them in real-time. Furthermore, the number of errors in the spelling of a word was positively correlated with reading speed. In conclusion, spelling accuracy as well as location and number of spelling errors within a word significantly hamper reading speed for these same words. These findings have significant implications for theory and educational settings.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:16Z

way consumers and musicians’ access, share and interact with music (Salo, Lankinen, & Mäntymäki, 2013). The music industry has shifted from a materialized to a dematerialized system since the digitalization of music began with the compact disc (Eiriz & Leite, 2017; Swanson, 2013). As a result, an increasing number of musicians are now responsible for
producing and managing their careers (Eiriz & Leite, 2017). In general, artists have both favourable and unfavourable attitudes towards streaming, depending on several factors or
whether they are fully independent or an established musician (Aly-Tovar, Bacache-Beauvallet, Bourreau & Moreau, 2019; Marshall, 2015). The way artists can connect with their listeners and
recruit new ones has drastically changed with the opportunities the internet has provided, e.g., utilizing different social media platforms and engaging with online communities (Salo et al.,
2013). How the success of an artist is measured has also changed both subjectively and objectively since the digitalization of music (Fisher, Pearson, Goolsby & Onken, 2010). Overall,
there are many components of the music industry that a musician has to be aware of while creating music and developing their career.
The majority of research on streaming platforms has been conducted in the consumer, record label and services sectors; however, little has explored the business models used by early
career musicians in a dematerialized market (Eiriz & Leite, 2017). To address this gap in the research, the current study investigated how early career musicians measure their success in the
2 age of streaming to uncover the challenges musicians face when establishing, expanding and maintaining their music career.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:01Z

related mortalities in Canada. It is heterogenous in development and presentation, therefore,
treatment strategies must be personalized to best treat the individual conditions of each patient.
Prognostic factors are used by physicians as a guiding tool in creating treatment strategies. For
that reason, it is important to understand the value that each prognostic factor provides in
estimating prognosis. Prognostic molecular biomarkers have recently demonstrated their
importance in predicting response to systemic therapies. In this study, a retrospective chart
review was conducted at a single institution located in New Brunswick, Canada, in order to
evaluate the demographic, clinical, and pathologic prognostic factors and their individual
influence on patient outcome in terms of overall survival and reoccurrence free survival. This
study also determined the simultaneous effect of multiple prognostic factors, lymph node yield
and resection margins, on patient outcome. In addition, adherence to specific CRC guidelines at
this institution were assessed for compliance in regards to lymph node yield and resection
margins. This study showed that for the relatively small sample of patients, the strongest
prognostic factors for overall survival was histologic grade of the tumour, while the strongest
prognostic factors for reoccurrence free survival were age at diagnosis, distal resection margin
and circumferential resection margin. When lymph node yield and resection margins were
assessed simultaneously their influence on patient outcome was not significant in improving
reoccurrence free survival even with adherence to guidelines. There was relatively high
compliance to CRC guidelines for both lymph node yield and circumferential resection margins.
Furthermore, this study also assessed the practicality of molecular investigating for a potential
prognostic biomarker, the RAD18 gene, in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. This
was done by evaluating a method for retrieving high quality DNA from FFPE. Gel
electrophoresis indicated high DNA fragmentation and unsuccessful amplification as a result of
the protocol used for FFPE tissue. Overall, these results allow for recognition of survival and
reoccurrence trends. Because there is no central database of CRC patient outcome after surgery
in the province of New Brunswick, our study may point to areas where further investigation is
needed. In the future, we hope this will provide a foundation for a larger survival analysis that
will increase knowledge on OS and RFS, allowing for more successful CRC patient outcome in
New Brunswick.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z

It is expected that their use will only increase as the nanotechnology industry grows, resulting in a higher risk of nAg pollution in aquatic ecosystems and higher risk of uptake by fish. Previous studies have shown nAg to be harmful to fish, but little have focused on the cardiac impact these nanoparticles have. Callaghan et al. (2018) showed that nAg decreased cardiac contraction rate and peak contractile force in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and suggested the nanoparticles induced these effects by impairing important proteins involved in excitation contraction coupling. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind the nAg-induced cardiac contraction effects, determine if these effects were reversible and determine if cell size was influential. Ventricular strips from diploid Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and diploid and triploid brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were mounted in an isometrically contracting muscle physiology system to assess the effects of nAg as well as nifedipine and ryanodine on the force-frequency relationship, peak contractile force and post-rest potentiation (% PRP). nAg treatment of Arctic char strips resulted in a significantly higher mean maximum pacing frequency and lower mean peak force, suggesting nAg-interference with Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Recovery tests involving the replenishment of saline were not successful, thereby implying nAg cardiac effects to be irreversible. No significant differences in peak force and % PRP of brook trout arose from nAg treatment, either pharmaceutical treatment or ploidy which suggested possible differences between species in excitation contraction coupling and nAg effects. Na+/K+ and total ATPase activity was also assessed in brook trout injected with 700 μg per kg nAg 24 hours before sampling and demonstrated nAg to decrease Na+/K+ ATPase activity significantly in both diploid and triploid fish, leading to the conclusion that nAg may affect cardiac contraction through at least two mechanisms: Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and Na+/K+ ATPases.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:50Z

Although many GIS models have been constructed to map the transport and sedimentation of various types of particulates through river systems, models specific to microplastics have yet to be developed. The goal of this study was to create a GIS based accumulation model of microplastics loading in the Saint John River
watershed. This model considers the location of potential microplastic point sources such as wastewater treatment plants and tributaries, as well as the rivers flow strength and direction. Observed suspected microplastic concentrations from the Kennebecasis and Naskwaak tributaries were used to calibrate and test the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Waste water treatment plants seem to be better predictors of suspected microplastic concentrations than tributary confluences. The outcome of this project will further the understanding of microplastics pollution in the Saint John River watershed, and will serve as a reference to implement similar models in other freshwater systems.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:23Z

My honours research contributes to answering the large question, “Are the developmental mechanisms that result in variation in spur length among flowers within individuals of H. deflexa the same as those that produce variation in spur length among species within the genus Halenia?” This question is beyond the scope of a single honours project, so my objective was to address the first part of the question. I aimed
to describe the floral developmental adjustments responsible for the within-plant variation of nectar spur lengths in Halenia deflexa. Specifically, my goals were (1) to develop methods for clearing, staining, and imaging preserved H. deflexa floral tissue, and (2) to describe what cellular changes are causing these variations in nectar spur lengths, whether it’s due to the size, shape, or number of cells, or some
combination of factors.
Historically within-plant variation has been mostly seen as inconvenient, an
irrelevant detail obscuring the mean (Herrera 2009). Recently, however, within-plant
variation is increasingly being investigated as a possible target for selection. This
research could be the first step towards uncovering some important evolutionary
significance in an under-appreciated trait. If within-plant variation is indeed a blueprint
for diversification, then maybe it can give us a glimpse into the evolutionary trajectory of
plants.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:46Z

A large subset of these GPCRs are orphans with no determined or validated endogenous ligand, which limits studies of their function and their potential pharmacological applications. Among many possible activating ligands, amino acids are able to activate some GPCRs. We hypothesized that L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) specifically would activate numerous GPCRs, including some orphan GPCRs. To study this, a high throughput activation screen of 277 GPCRs that included 64 orphan GPCRs was conducted with a 3 mM L-Phe treatment and compared to a vehicle treatment. This L-Phe treatment significantly activated 44 of 64 orphan GPCRs, where the GPCRs GPR88, GPR45, GPR31, CXCR7, and GPR32 exhibited the highest magnitude in activation from baseline activity levels at above seven-fold. A database search showed that the tissue distributions of these orphan GPCRs were also variable, with highest GPCR expression reported in the brain and the gastrointestinal system. These findings support the idea that L-Phe is a GPCR ligand and that it potentially deorphanizes some of these orphan GPCRs. By looking at GPCR activation with L-Phe, we can gain a greater understanding of the biological implications of L-Phe beyond protein assembly.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:15Z

At the start of the season, H. deflexa flowers produced have long nectar spurs, but by the end of the season, nectar spur length declines significantly. This within-plant variation between early flowers and late produced flowers offers a character upon which natural selection could act. Nectar spurs offer a sugary reward to pollinators that then bring in outcross pollen for fertilization. Therefore, a decline in nectar spur length throughout the season could affect H. deflexa mating system. Halenia deflexa could be entirely self-incompatible, relying on outcrossing as its only mechanism for reproduction. On the other
hand, H. deflexa could exclusively self or have a mixed mating system where both outcrossing and selfing are used. I compared plants with full pollinator access to pollinator excluded plants in bags to investigate this potential interaction between nectar spur and mating system. However, I observed no effect of pollinator access on H. deflexa fruit set or number of seeds per fruit throughout the season. I also compared emasculated flowers with anthers removed to intact flowers to observe the effects of autogamy on H. deflexa mating system. The ability to reproduce through autogamy increases fruit set throughout the season. Autogamous fruit produce more seeds than non-autogamous fruit early in the season, but by the end of the season there is no difference between the two. Collectively, my studies indicate that H. deflexa has a mixed mating system that does not rely on pollinators to successfully reproduce.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:22Z

management practices and contaminants were released into the environment. One notable

monitoring data are sparse, nearby freshwaters likely received contaminants from past mining
activities through inputs from surface waters and the atmosphere. To investigate the long-term
effects of historic gold mining practices on lake ecosystems, I examined zooplankton remains
and sediment geochemistry archived in dated sediment cores from impacted (Lake Charles) and
reference (Loon Lake) lakes. Sedimentary concentrations of arsenic (As) were used to infer past
mining activities. Sedimentary chlorophyll-a concentrations were used as a proxy of trends in
lake primary production. Cladoceran assemblages of both lakes were significantly different (p <
0.05) during the time period of mining, compared to pre- and post-mining periods. Geochemical
and zooplankton changes were most extreme in Lake Charles, which recorded levels of As
contamination that exceeded sediment guidelines by, on average, 300 times since gold mining
began. Despite the Montague Gold Mine closing 80 years ago, modern bioindicator and

Participants listened to a series of audio vignettes describing monogamous, non-monogamous, and neutral relationships while their electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), and emotional affective states were measured. Another vignette that asked participants to imagine being asked to engage in CNM by a partner was also included.

Study 2 involved participants first completing an online survey of their attitudes towards CNM, their level of disgust sensitivity, narcissism, and religiosity. From those who completed the survey, a subset of 16 participants with came into the lab for the same protocol as Study 1. There were no differences in the physiological results across the relationship vignettes, but the Imagine vignette resulted in significantly lower mean EDA and significantly higher HR and negative affect. Unexpectedly, positive attitudes towards CNM were found to be positively correlated with EDA and heart rate during different vignettes.

However, learning to recognize objects by touch leads to similar performance across haptic and visual identification, violating the principle of encoding specificity. Further, recent studies have found that object representations may rely on a verbal encoding process, but this may be attributable to the visual simplicity of the objects used. I therefore evaluated whether learning to recognize complex novel objects would generate similar performance as learning to recognize simple novel objects. Participants completed learning trials where they explored each object by sight or by touch, and test trials where they identified objects by sight and by touch. Bayesian analyses indicated similar  erformance across object types: similar objects were confused more often than distinct objects, and participants who learned to identify objects by touch demonstrated a violation of encoding specificity. Further, an interaction between learning condition and stimulus type emerged: participants who visually learned to identify simple objects made fewer errors than those who haptically learned to identify simple objects. In contrast, identification performance for participants who visually or haptically learned to identify complex objects was comparable.

These murderous rampages have been condoned by the idea that the perpetrators were working to combat climate change. These perpetrators are self-proclaimed ecofascists. Michael E. Zimmerman offers a brief and simplified definition of ecofascism (Zimmerman, 2008). Ecofascism, according to Zimmerman, is “a totalitarian government that requires individuals to sacrifice their interests to the well-being of the 'land', understood as the splendid web of life, or the organic whole of nature, including peoples and their states"" (Zimmerman, 2008). Ecofascism, however, does not target all people equally. Notably, ecofascists target those marginalized by racialization, disability, gender, and immigration status.
While ecofascism was widespread in and prior to Nazi Germany, it has seen a resurgence in recent years. This has been attributed to rising concern regarding the climate crisis and the invention of the internet which has made ecofascist communities (by way of internet forums) readily available to almost anyone at any time. Most ecofascists (or even people who do not explicitly call themselves by this name but certainly tout its principles) do not perpetrate mass shootings or bombs. Rather, their violence comes by way of advocating against progressive values, policies, and discourse. Most ecofascists enact their violence through dangerous rhetoric, promoting ideas such as eugenics, race science, and anti-immigration discourse. While this may not be direct violence in the way a mass shooting is, it is nonetheless deadly. Imperialism, extraction, and closed borders do lead to real, tangible harm, human death, and suffering.
While this rhetoric is not explicitly violent in the way that a mass shooting is, it is violent in the hatred it breeds. Ecofascists strive for a future where a ‘clean’ climate is dependent on human suffering- they argue only some are worthy of living on such a planet. Ecofascists believe that there is a scarcity of resources, and that it must thus be determined who “deserves” these resources. Unsurprisingly, this benefits global elites and harms those who are marginalized by systems like capitalism, racism, and misogyny. This is clearly not ethical or the only way forward. Ecofascism exists in stark contrast to
MacDougall Fleming 6
environmental justice, which seeks equitable benefits of a clean and healthy environment for all communities.
Ecofascist discourse can disseminate from grim corners of the internet and enter popular discourse. That being said, there is little to no research regarding how ecofascist rhetoric disseminates into popular discourse surrounding the climate crisis. One way that discourse is introduced and circulated throughout society is through the news media. The news media is a trusted source for information and is strategically framed as an objective, unbiased informant. A feminist analysis of this notion would argue that news is not unbiased, and that individual perceptions of the world are translated through discourse. This is especially true and potentially dangerous when the source is funded by large, multi-billion dollar familial empires, industries, or nations with their own set of values and motives.

These secretions are critical in the development of insulin-resistance and type II diabetes. Many adipokines are endogenous ligands to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Thus, it is possible that these disease-modulating hormones are connected to GPCRs with currently unidentified endogenous ligands, orphan GPCRs. The aim of this study was to identify if orphan GPCRs are adipokine sensing receptors and can detect the difference between healthy and insulin-resistant adipocytes. This was achieved through the screening of healthy and insulin-resistant adipocyte-conditioned media against 71 orphan GPCRs. Receptor activation was quantified using the PRESTO-Tango β-arrestin recruitment assay. Adipocyte-conditioned media significantly altered the activation of 19 receptor candidates. Further, insulin-resistant adipocyte conditioned media significantly altered the activation of GPR17, GPR45 and GPR54 relative to healthy adipocyte-conditioned media. This led to a recommendation of 12 receptor candidates for further investigation. The activation of these twelve receptors was summarized into three categories: 1) receptors significantly activated by both adipocyte-conditioned media 2) receptors with significantly decreased activation by both adipocyte-conditioned media and 3) receptors that were differentially activated between the two adipocyte-conditioned media. These findings demonstrate the diverse connections between adipocytes and the receptor candidates. Further investigation into the 12 receptor candidates will lead to greater knowledge about the function of these elusive receptors. This will aid in identifying endogenous ligands for these receptor candidates, and in the application of these findings to the development of therapeutic treatments for type II diabetes.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:11Z

The participants had difficulty recalling the second of the two targets, and the presentation of the tone did not reduce this deficit. In Experiment 2, all participants heard tones presented simultaneously with the second target, but half of these participants had the additional task of providing a verbal response when they heard a rare tone frequency. In this case, the additional task of responding to some of the tones did not have the re-orienting effect as expected. Instead, the additional task caused more difficulty recalling the two target words.

challenges in its endemic habitat of Macquarie Harbour, Tasmania, Australia. Among these
challenges are highly stratified waters with variable temperatures, oxygen saturation, and
salinity, and increasing salmonid aquaculture. It is known that the skate is capable of tolerating
short-term hypoxic exposure, but much of its physiology remains unknown. Decreasing trends in
oxygen saturation throughout all layers of the harbour over the last decade correspond with
increases in salmonid aquaculture, and increased occurrences of major storms may exacerbate
these declines. As such, I investigated the Maugean skate’s physiological responses to chronic
hypoxia to understand what affect it may have on these endangered animals. I exposed the skates
to either hypoxia (20% DO) or normoxia (90% DO) for 96-hours, immediately after which, I
measured their metabolic rate at 20% DO. I quantified lactate and glycogen concentrations in
tissue samples taken immediately following the metabolic rate test and both pre- and postexposure
plasma samples. I found that skates exposed to hypoxia for 96-hours exhibited
significantly lower metabolic rates than their normoxic counterparts. Plasma lactate
concentrations were undetectable in the field, and there was no significant difference in tissue
lactate or glycogen concentrations relative to normoxic tissues. My results indicate that the
Maugean skate is extremely hypoxia tolerant and copes with chronic hypoxia by depressing its
metabolism to potentially limit glycogen use and lactate production. While the skates seem to be
able to tolerate chronic hypoxia through metabolic depression, this may limit their ability to
forage and/or reproduce, which may inhibit population recovery.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:51Z

Such interactions include that eCBs diminish NO signaling and NO is required for eCB signaling. I aimed to determine if the requirement of NO for eCB signaling is mediated by CB1R expression. To determine the effects of NO on CB1R expression, young male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into two groups: (1) acute robust exposure to L-arginine (100mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection or vehicle (saline) injection and (2) prolonged modest exposure to L-arginine by supplemented water (2.25%) and control distilled water for control. It was determined by RT-PCR that the hypothalamus of animals receiving an acute exposure to L-arginine showed a significant increase in CB1R mRNA, but not the cortex or hippocampus. Prolonged treatment with L-arginine water did not cause a significant change in CB1R expression. Results from RT-PCR experiments lead to obtaining electrophysiological recordings from the DMH, a region known to exhibit interactions between NO and eCBs. Electrophysiological recordings were used to determine the effects of L-arginine on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission at glutamate synapses. To do this, animals received the same acute and robust exposure to L-arginine that was found to increase CB1R mRNA in the hypothalamus. Whole cell recordings from DMH neurons were performed to determine the effect of L-arginine on neuronal excitability and the ability of glutamate synapses to undergo long-term changes in synaptic strength in response to high frequency stimulation (HFS). It was found that glutamate synapses from animals receiving Larginine injections were less excitable than those from vehicle-treated animals. In animals receiving a vehicle treatment, there was a short-term potentiation of glutamate signaling
observed in the first five-minutes after HFS. This short-term potentiation was abolished in animals which received L-arginine. No long-term changes in synaptic strength were observed with either treatment. These findings suggest that L-arginine may increase CB1R expression in the DMH, causing a decrease in neuronal excitability as well as masking short-term potentiation post-HFS at glutamate synapses. Future research is required to confirm if the L-arginine effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission are CB1R mediated.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:04Z

Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the concept of microfinance as a strategic anti-poverty mechanism occupied a vast and dynamic space within the field of international development. Popularized by economist and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize co-recipient Dr. Muhammad Yunus, microfinance is rooted in a local experiment in Bangladesh with the purpose of promoting self-employment and small-scale entrepreneurship, particularly among impoverished and disempowered women. During the first stages of its development, microfinance was arguably a revolutionary concept for poverty alleviation. Its original objective was to reach the most impoverished through the provision of small loans that could be used for entrepreneurial endeavors and revenue generating projects. Microfinance was seen as a way to reduce extreme poverty, empower women, and increase the quality of life for the borrowers. Between 1997 and 2005 the number of microfinance institutions increased from 618 to 3,133, and the number of borrowers rose from 13.5 million to 113.3 million (84 % of them being women) (Hermes and Lensink, 2007).
After gaining popularity and support from development scholars, policy circles, and the public as a poverty alleviating tool, microfinance as a concept also became an attractive revenue generating site for profit seeking commercial banks and multi-national corporations. The expansion of microfinance policy opened up a new opportunity for commercial banks to integrate microfinance into their banking portfolios, which was framed as an effort to better serve the impoverished by increasing the value and amount of loans available to them. More in-depth and frequent evaluations of microfinance success rates have brought to light the corrupt and manipulative potential that microfinance has when used in a profit seeking context, leaving the practice as a target of moral criticism and ethical questioning (Hudon, 2011). Notable scholars, such as Karim (2008), suggests how the shift that microfinance has experienced in the late 1990s and early 2000’s, from a bottom up, grassroots approach to poverty reduction, to a top down, profit seeking approach, runs in parallel with the spread of neoliberal economic policy to developing communities, further ingraining dependent relations between the powerful rich and the vulnerable poor. In addition, the culturally insensitive practices of many profit seeking microfinance institutions not only perpetuate the debt cycle and expand the neoliberalglobalization agenda to the South, but they can also trigger conditions such as mass suicides and severe stress related health problems (Ashta, et al., 2011).
The following study will engage with the dangers and negative impacts that small microfinance institutions face when they are co-opted by profit seeking commercial banks and other for-profit financial institutions. It will highlight the deliberate and exploitative measures that further develop dependent relationships between borrowers and lenders through pushing the impoverished deeper into poverty traps and debt cycles. It will suggest the necessity of reevaluating modern microfinance practices as a poverty alleviation tool, and present valuable innovations that microfinance institutions have used in their programs in order to create a sustainable and well-rounded poverty alleviation tool. The main focus of the analysis will establish the high risk of mission drift that modern day microfinance institutions encounter, as the scope of microfinance within international development continues to lean more towards neoliberal economic policy, rather than grassroots, not-for-profit development strategies, and how this is a detriment to the borrowers who are involved. Throughout the analysis, this thesis will also highlight the large gap in empirical research within the study of microfinance that further deepens the divide between critics and advocates of microfinance, as the evidence for or against microfinance is typically limited to anecdotal instances or cases. The study concludes by claiming that the commercialization of microfinance organizations is an inefficient, exploitative, and contradictory attempt at the original aim of microfinance and its poverty alleviation vision, and that grassroots microfinance organizations who strive for capacity expansion through commercialization effectively limit their success of poverty alleviation through their risk of mission drift, or complete co-optation by commercial organizations. The following portion of the introduction provides a brief context of microfinance, in addition to the discussing the two key questions of this study: 1) What is the context of the borrowers’ situation, and is microfinance effective in alleviating their impoverished situation? and 2) What are the risks and negative impacts of mission drift, and how has the commercialization of microfinance created a counter intuitive economic concept that actively exploits and deepens the socio-economic disparities within developing communities?",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:54Z

Gold District between the 1860s and 1940s. The mine tailings produced were transported into the 
local environment and likely contributed to pollution of the Shubenacadie Canal drainage 
basin. In this study, I used paleolimnological approaches to understand the long-term ecological 
effects of historical gold mining operations on benthic invertebrates in Lake Thomas. 
Sedimentary concentrations of total arsenic (As) and total mercury (Hg) were measured from a 
dated sediment core to track pollution history. Subfossil chironomid remains were analyzed to 
examine biological effects of mining pollution on the benthos. Sedimentary As and Hg levels 
were low prior to gold mining activities; however, during the mining era concentrations of both 
elements increased. Chironomid production declined by half from the pre-mining period and 
suggests biological impacts from historical mining pollution. Chironomid assemblage
compositions between pre-mining and post-mining periods were significantly different 
(p<0.003). Recent sediments showed mining-related contaminants were higher than national 
sediment quality guidelines by ~12x for As and ~11x for Hg. Although the Waverley Gold 
District was closed to mining eight decades ago, elevated contaminant levels from historical 
mining may still be affecting the composition and production of aquatic biota associated with the 
benthic habitat. My research contributes to the growing number of environmental assessments

The current study examined whether an attentional boost effect manipulation could reduce the attentional blink deficit by having participants respond to auditory targets presented simultaneously with target words. A follow-up experiment attempted to replicate an earlier study that reduced the size of the attention blink deficit using sound alone, without the boost manipulation (Olivers and Van der Burg, 2008). Results showed no modulation of the attentional blink effect in the first experiment, but a modulation in the second experiment, wherein sound presented simultaneously with a target improved memory accuracy.

This project aimed to observe sexual behavior and auxospore development in the polar centric group, Thalassiosirales, that maintains the morphology of a nonpolar centric diatom. Auxosporulation is the main means of restoring large cell sizes in the majority of diatom species examined. Monoclonal cultures of T. weissflogii (CCMP1587), T. nordenskioeldii (CCMP997) and Thalassiosira cf. oceanica were subjected to sexual induction protocols, resulting in non-typical cells. Spermatogenesis was not observed and presumed absent in all inductions. Spherical cells with non-siliceous cell walls were observed, occurring in about 12% of the population for T. nordenskioeldii, and 17% in T. weissflogii. However, these spherical cells were not eggs or auxospores and further observations using light microscopy (LM) suggest that these cells were arrested in this stage of enlargement and eventually died. Spherical and irregular shaped cells were observed in T. weissflogii, as well as cells in general appearance similar to auxospores. The nuclear behavior observed in T. weissflogii indicates that this species could reproduce via autogamy, but mature initial cells enclosed within such “auxospores” were never observed. Inductions were not successful in Thalassiosira cf. oceanica. In the absence of gametogenesis and mature auxospores, the larger typical vegetative cells encountered in cultures following induction protocols in T. nordenskioeldii and T. weissflogii are therefore attributed to vegetative cell enlargement.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:41Z

seen. Interestingly, recent research has identified that when individuals view or touch an object, 
they may create a verbal memory representation; however, this research involved object naming, 
which may have prompted the use of verbal strategies. Past research has also identified 
variability in memory representations for objects, which may indicate that there are individual 
differences at play. To investigate memory representations and their association with individual 
differences in cognitive styles, we measured the cognitive styles of 127 undergraduate 
participants, and had them complete a non-verbal matching task where they viewed an object and 
then touched an object – or vice versa - and indicated whether the two objects were congruent or 
incongruent. Participants completed the task without distractors, or with verbal or visual 
distractors. Participants responded consistently faster for trials where they touched an object first. 
On these trials, they were also more likely to erroneously respond that the objects were different; 
whereas in trials where participants viewed an object first, they were more likely to erroneously 
respond that the objects were identical. On trials where different objects were presented, 
participants responded consistently more slowly and made more matching errors for similar 
objects compared to distinct objects. Finally, the representations that participants used in 
cross-modal object matching may be verbally facilitated, since higher scores on the verbalizer 
cognitive style were associated with faster reaction times on the matching task when no 
distractors were present. Overall, this indicates that cross-modal object processing in short-term 
memory may be facilitated by a verbal code; however, the addition of distractors may prompt 
participants to recruit more idiosyncratic strategies.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:53Z

Some research suggests that these spatial deficits extend to other types of cognitive processing, not just memory, and that deficits associated with all of these are caused by degradation of spatial relational representations. To address this in future studies, I designed a task that encompassed both object and spatial perception using the same task and same stimuli, going beyond previous paradigms which employed different tasks and stimuli. In a pilot study, nine young adult participants (age = 19.89, edu = 14.44) viewed a scene and a floor plan simultaneously, side-by-side, and judged whether object identity or location matched between the two. Across trials, the scene either matched the floor plan, the identity of an object differed from the floor plan, or the location of an object differed from the floor plan. Scenes were presented from a centre or off-centre viewpoint. Results revealed that accuracy rates were neither too high nor too low to make meaningful comparisons in task performance. While there were trade-offs between speed and accuracy, combining both measures showed that performance was well-matched across conditions. Viewpoint manipulation affected performance, with participants making more errors on location mismatch scenes presented from an off-centre viewpoint. These results suggest that the floor plan task is well-suited for comparing the differing processes involved in object and scene perception. Future studies will be able to compare performance between object and spatial conditions as well as between age groups.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:49Z

people should maintain a positive outlook. The present research aimed to demonstrate 
that toxic positivity is a measurable construct through the development of the Binns 
Toxic Positivity Scale (BTPS). For Study One a community sample (N = 94) completed 
an initial set of 13 items to index toxic positivity. Factor analysis showed that items 
could be reduced to two subscales: Control and Positivity. Each subscale showed 
acceptable reliability, and correlations between the two subscales and emotion 
regulation strategies provided evidence of validity. Importantly, the subscales failed to 
correlate with optimism, indicating that the BTPS assesses a separate construct. The 
purpose of Study Two was two-fold: (1) to examine the psychometric properties of a 
revised BTPS and (2) to assess the impact of mood. Results from a sample of 
undergraduates (N = 142) showed that the revised Control and Positivity subscales were 
reliable. However, the evidence for validity was mixed. Specifically, the Control 
subscale was associated with more optimism, self-compassion, and better mental health, 
indicating that aspects of toxic positivity may have benefits for individuals. Of interest 
was the finding that participants who received toxic positivity feedback after reading an 
imaginary scenario of failure experienced more negative mood than participants who 
received compassionate feedback. This negative impact of toxic positivity on mood was 
moderated by individuals’ level of self-compassion. Overall, findings illustrate that toxic 
positivity is a measurable construct, that scores relate to emotion regulation strategies, 
and that toxic positivity statements have negative impacts on others. Future research 
should focus on refinement of the BTPS and validity of its utility.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:23Z

Findings that scheduled reinforcement exerts only limited control on operant wheel running served as the basis for the current study. Eight female Long-Evans rats were exposed to a series of FR schedules (FR 5, 15, 40, and 80) for 0.1 ml of 20% sucrose solution and again with 0% sucrose (water). Wheel revolutions at each ratio size produced outcomes (sucrose or water), and wheel running rates were assessed for each scheduled reinforcement rate (FR size). Results showed significantly higher wheel-running rates for sucrose reinforcement than water; however, the difference in rates by outcome was modest and independent of the control exerted by FR size alone. For both outcomes, wheel-running rates decreased, and latency to initiate running increased as FR size increased and the reinforcement rate decreased. The lack of variation in the reinforcing effect of sucrose as the FR size varied differs from findings with operant behaviours such as key pecking and lever pressing. This finding suggests that automatic reinforcement and constraint on the opportunity to run might help explain these differences, but further research is required to substantiate these findings.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:16Z

In a recent electrophysiology study using brain slice recordings from young rats, CCK was found to activate CCK2 receptors (CCK2R) and interact with nitric oxide (NO) to increase the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA onto appetite regulatory neurons in the DMH. However, it is unclear whether this is the pathway through which CCK supresses appetite, thus necessitating the use of in vivo studies in young rats to elucidate the function of this pathway in relation to CCK. In the current study, we implanted bilateral guide cannulas into the DMH of young, male rats and administered injections of either 1) vehicle (aCSF), 2) CCK, 3) CCK + a NO synthase inhibitor, 4) CCK + a CCK2 receptor antagonist or 5) a NO synthase inhibitor, into food deprived animals. Following injections food intake, change in body weight and latency to feed were measured over a two-hour period. We also looked at the effect of CCK in young rats given a high fat diet (HFD) using two treatments 1) vehicle (aCSF) + HFD and 2) CCK + HFD. We found that CCK suppresses food intake in young rats and does so through interactions with NO but not CCK2 receptors in the DMH. We also found that the appetite suppressing effects of CCK had no impact on latency to feed. Finally, CCK was unable to suppress appetite in rats given high fat food. By confirming that CCK supresses appetite through NO signaling in the DMH this project provides a potential therapeutic target for future drugs to combat obesity.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:26Z

Strains of Prochlorococcus at different depths exhibit diverse responses to light, however, they are notoriously difficult to culture and consequently few of these strains have been studied in vitro. As the past research that has been conducted on Prochlorococcus demonstrates novel and diverse photosynthetic strategies, we have analyzed mass spectrally detected Prochlorococcus peptides, obtained from North Pacific Ocean water samples, to investigate the photosynthetic strategies of wild Prochlorococcus in their natural habitat. We focussed on the major photosynthetic structures: the light harvesting Prochlorophyte Chlorophyll Binding proteins, photosystem II, cytochrome b6f, and photosystem I as well as the rate-limiting enzyme in the Calvin cycle, Rubisco, the NADPH Dehydrogenase complex, plastiquinol terminal oxidase, the ATP synthase complex and the FtsH proteases purportedly involved in photosystem repair. We found that Prochlorococcus in the North Pacific Ocean do not photosynthesize below 200 m and may become heterotrophic under low oxygen and light conditions, suggesting potential for mixotrophy under other conditions. It was further found that some Prochlorococcus in the North Pacific Ocean are deficient in Cytochrome b6f and may therefore be using novel alternative electron transport strategies. We found a strong correlation between Rubisco expression and oxygen, suggesting increased capacity to fix carbon
and perform linear electron transport in high oxygen conditions. We further found that lowlight preferring strains have little capacity to repair their photosystems due to deficiency in FtsH proteases. The overall results of the present research show that Prochlorococcus uses ecotype, clade and strain-specific photosynthetic strategies that are associated with not only depth (and consequently light) but oxygen concentrations as well. Therefore, it is proposed that a dichotomous classification considering both depth/light and oxygen preferences of each strain would better reflect the diversity of photosynthetic capacities of individual strains. The results of this research give insight into future directions for the continued study of Prochlorococcus.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:08Z

However, previous studies have demonstrated a violation of this principle for objects learned by touch, for which identification was equally efficient by sight and by touch. This indicates that sight and touch have a shared memory representation. The present study was concerned with the nature of this shared representation, whether it was primarily visual, verbal, or a combination of both. Seventy-seven participants completed a learning phase where they were asked to learn to recognize eight novel objects haptically or visually. Participants completed the learning phase while being presented with either a verbal, visual, haptic distractor, or no distractor. They then completed an experimental phase where there were presented with an object they could see and one they could touch; they were asked to identify one of the objects and ignore the other. We replicated the violation of encoding specificity, found that visual distractor interfered with haptic identification, and while we hypothesized that a distractor would interfere, none significantly did. This may have been because our interference did not require participants to actively engage with the distractors.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:49Z

about conventional transgressions. Results revealed that children rated moral 
transgressions as more severe than conventional, however, no age differences were 
found. Older children provided a higher proportion of reasons compared to younger 
children. Children suggested that moral transgressions were wrong because someone 
was a victim or the action was bad, while conventional transgressions were wrong

multisensory memory trace that is accessible to both modalities. Past research examining the 
composition of this overlapping memory trace have found evidence for a visual as well as a 
verbal component. Lacey and Campbell (2006) reported that non-verbal visual distractors 
impacted the identification of known objects, suggesting a visual component to this shared 
representation. Contrarily, Desmarais et al. (2021) found that only verbal distractors 
negatively impact the identification of novel objects, suggesting that this shared memory 
trace is therefore verbal in composition. Therefore, the question remains: what is this shared 
memory trace between sight and touch composed of, and does this memory trace depend on 
the type of object encoded? The current study also examined whether this depends on 
individual differences in cognitive style, as one’s preferred method for obtaining and 
applying information could explain the conflicting findings of past research. Participants 
first completed a self-report measure of cognitive style, followed by an object identification 
task that required them to learn to identify either simple or complex objects, either by sight 
or by touch. Two-thirds of participants simultaneously completed either a verbal or 
visuospatial distractor task. Participants learning to recognize complex objects produced 
more errors and required more blocks to reach criterion compared to those learning simple 
objects. Participants who completed the task without distraction displayed superior 
identification performance compared to those who experienced a visuospatial distractor, 
especially when identifying complex objects. Finally, we demonstrated that the information 
that composes this overlapping memory representation can be associated with one’s 
cognitive style. However, the degree to which this occurs may depend on the types of

Vegetative cell enlargement was induced by allowing cultures of cells to deplete their medium of nutrients and subsequently introducing nutrient replete medium. Enlargement was examined by light microscope, epifluorescence microscope with DAPI and PDMPO (2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl)oxalole) stain. Attempts at observation enlarged cells under the scanning electron microscope were unsuccessful due to fragility of enlarged valves. Vegetative cell enlargement was confirmed to occur as cells enlarged and their non-enlarged valves remained on the cell. D. brightwellii was observed to vegetatively enlarge their cells through two methods: one-step enlargement, and multi-step enlargement. During one-step enlargement, a single D. brightwellii cell will enlarge without producing supernumerary valves. Multi-step enlargement is the opposite, where D. brightwellii cells produce progressively larger supernumerary valves. Resting cells were observed to occur in all samples and were not induced through any experimental methods. Resting cells were observed to exit the valves (naked cells) and produce pseudopod-like structures. The pseudopod structures were observed to move freely on a microscope slide and could extent or retract. Resting spores were induced by inoculating D. brightwellii into a nitrogen depleted medium, also known as T medium. Resting spores were induced after 2 weeks of being inoculated in the nitrogen depleted medium. D. brightwellii cells plasmolysed in the T medium and remained plasmolysed until they became resting spores.

Contemporary medicine has become more personalized, and the field of nanomedicine has developed in an attempt to develop more targeted cancer treatments to reduce these off-target effects. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are of particular interest because of their unique and modifiable physicochemical properties as well as high biocompatibility and low immunogenicity. This study investigated AuNP conjugated to four different ligands with distinct surface chemistry: polyethylene glycol (PEG), trimethylamine bromide (TMAB), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and carboxyl (COOH). The impact of AuNP surface chemistry upon various parameters of cytotoxicity in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells was evaluated with a range of cytotoxicity assays. Parameters of cytotoxicity assessed in this study include metabolic function as measured with an MTT assay, oxidative stress as measured by a DCF assay, cell health as measured by a colony forming assay, and cell viability as measured by a neutral red assay. Morphological features of SKOV3 cells treated with each AuNP were also examined for characteristics of cell death. Results of these cytotoxicity and morphological evaluations suggest that AuNP-PEG induce apoptotic cell death, AuNP-TMAB induce oxidative stress that does not result in cell death, AuNP-DMAP induce autophagy cell death, and AuNP-COOH induce anoikis-apoptotic cell death.

Exosomes contain fragmented DNA, nucleic acids and microRNAs (miRNA) and are present in numerous cell types across the body and in many bodily fluids, for these reasons they have gotten plenty of recognition as potential biomarkers (4–8). This work centers on a transcriptome analysis of the total RNA and the microRNA within exosomes to better understand the changing regulation at the genomic level. Another aspect of this study was molecular detection of B. burgdorferi by urine analysis to develop more non-invasive methods of detection to ease the diagnostic process. Therefore, canine urine analysis was complete to determine if a diagnosis of LD is possible. This study showed that the clustering phenomena had resulted from the exosome isolation procedure, showing that it was not specific enough to discern between other micro-vesicles and pulled some non-exosome bodies out of the solution. The RNA extracted from bovine exosomes demonstrated a low concentration and quality; therefore, the samples from mice were not used in the RNA extraction process. For the canine samples, it was seen that the melt curves showed DNA for a single species had amplified. Post PCR reamplification of the qPCR samples, positive bands for B. burgdorferi were produced, yet sequencing was unable to confirm the identity of all samples. Of the samples that were able to be sequenced, some did identify as B. burgdorferi. However, some amplicons were other species; further methodology optimization is needed. The detection techniques discussed in this study could be applied to veterinary care and perhaps in the future in human health care.

throughout history. As a result, the workforce is comprised of individuals who have been taught 
primarily through textual means. Text-based learning perpetuates a cycle of information transfer 
(i.e., students read what their teachers have read). This system has become outdated as we move 
toward a society that is increasingly reliant on visual media and technology. Instead of sitting 
down with a textbook, students need to be allowed the option of learning in a way that provides 
them with information while simultaneously enhancing and teaching skills that lie outside the 
realm of memorization.
Unlike text-based literacy, visual literacy allows students to learn effectively through 
visual media by teaching them how to take meaning away from this media at a deeper cognitive 
level. One way to update the standard curriculum that is followed in high schools, universities, 
and post-graduate institutions is to implement a course or series of courses that teach students 
about visual literacy. This would be especially beneficial for medical school where students 
acquire the knowledge necessary to treat patients in a holistic manner. While student learning in 
medical schools is rooted in textual sources, the real-world application of what students learn 
must extend beyond their memorization of terms and treatments. In addition to the analyzing 
and assessing of patient symptoms, the doctor-patient relationship is essential to medical care 
and is known to impact a patient’s recovery. Therefore, doctor-patient interaction is rooted in 
empathy and communication, not something that can be taught through a text but, as I will 
demonstrate, something that can be imparted through visual means. Thus, this thesis addresses 
the need for visual literacy training across multiple levels of schooling with a strong focus on 
postgraduate medical studies.
A compulsory course on visual literacy is essential in both undergraduate studies and
medical schools because it would develop necessary and crucial skills desired in various fields,
particularly the medical field. These abilities include leadership, empathy, communication, and
critical analysis. Many of the ways in which these skills apply to future physicians are applicable
across a variety of fields. Proper training and teaching ensure that it is possible for everyone to
develop these traits that are crucial to the workforce. The compulsory course mentioned above
must cover several topics in the field of visual literacy and a proposed framework for this course
will be provided. This proposed framework includes several modules beginning with teaching
the principles of visual analysis and exemplifying this by providing images, paintings, and video
clips, asking students to create images of their own, analysis of images in closer relation
to students’ field of study, and multiple discussion periods. A course like this can be modified to
fit into any school or program's curriculum; however, in this thesis, the course proposition is
intended specifically for medical students. Prior to delving into the topic described above, it is
crucial to first lay down the foundations of what visual literacy is and how it is related to various
fields of study, particularly the medical profession.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:46Z

This compound is thought to be an important osmoprotectant to both producers and grazers. It is known to counteract stressors algae encounter in the euphotic zone such as fluctuating salinity, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and grazing. When liberated into marine surface waters, dissolved DMSP becomes an important source of carbon and reduced sulfur for the marine microbial community and through its breakdown into dimethylsulfide (DMS), the chief biogenic vehicle for sulfur transit into the atmosphere. The importance of DMSP has been well studied and known for decades, but less is known about the enzymes that govern its biosynthesis in marine algae. Earlier studies identified and partially characterized the 4 biosynthetic enzymes from tissue extracts of the macroalgae Ulva intestinalis but lacked thorough analysis of the individual enzymes. The sequencing of the Ulva mutabilis genome revealed a megasynthetase encoding a tripartite fusion protein with domains consistent with catalyzing the last three enzymatic steps of DMSP biosynthesis. This discovery enabled the design of recombinant proteins of the individual domains with encoded affinity tags for chromatographic purification to enable the isolation of pure enzyme. This project sought to leverage these recombinant variants to expand the understanding of the second-step enzyme, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate (MTOB) reductase, the putative 2-D-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-coupled stereospecific reduction of MTOB to D-4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutyrate (MTHB). This study finds that recombinant C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged MTOB reductase is likely inactive, that purification should be further refined to eliminate contaminating proteins, and that MTOB reductase-specific antibody purification for this protein was unsuccessful. Additionally, this project has produced 2 new recombinant versions of MTOB reductase for future testing.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:49Z

Such partitioning plays an important role in determining interspecific competition and community structure by allowing multiple species to coexist. Many species of shorebirds use stopover sites in Atlantic Canada to fuel their annual southbound migration in late summer and early fall. The Bay of Fundy is recognized as a landscape of hemispheric importance for migratory shorebirds, and hosts hundreds of thousands of Semipalmated Sandpipers annually. Other stopover sites on the eastern coast of New Brunswick, Canada, host smaller but more diverse shorebird populations. There is a lack of research on stopover ecology of whole shorebird communities in New Brunswick, especially at small coastal stopover sites. We examined stopover ecology at staging areas in the Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait to examine niche dynamics relative to shorebird behaviour and habitat use. Foraging strategies and rates varied among shorebird species at stopover sites on the Northumberland Strait and also between Semipalmated Sandpipers in the Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait. We found that Short-billed Dowitchers primarily forage by probing, and Semipalmated Plovers forage by pecking. Semipalmated Sandpipers, White-rumped Sandpipers, Least Sandpipers, and Yellowlegs used a combination of pecking and probing. Diets also varied between species and sites. We found that Semipalmated Sandpipers and Semipalmated Plovers consume generalist diets, while the diets of Short-billed Dowitchers and White-rumped Sandpipers were more specialized for specific food sources. Different taxa face foraging constraints based on morphological features, which creates both spatial and behavioural segregation. This was evident on the Northumberland Strait, probably because greater environmental heterogeneity in small coastal sites created more dimensions for segregation than large mudflat sites. As a result, a wider diversity of species can co-exist. Small coastal sites constitute important stopover habitat for migratory shorebirds outside of the Bay of Fundy. These findings broaden our understanding of stopover ecology of multi-species flocks and indicate that conservation of small coastal sites is also important for success of migratory shorebirds in Atlantic Canada.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:44Z

Despite the research on online learning, there is still a great deal of uncertainty that surrounds the components that contribute to effective and productive online learning. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relationship between past predictors of online learning in the context of a global pandemic. A total of 119 undergraduate students completed measures on self-efficacy, preparedness for online learning, lifestyle suitability, persistence, satisfaction, and the impact of COVID-19 on online learning. As expected, correlations and regressions showed that self-efficacy was positively associated with the three outcomes of academic success, persistence, and satisfaction. Despite being correlated, preparedness for online learning was not a significant predictor of academic success, however, it was a significant predictor of satisfaction. Similarly, lifestyle suitability did not predict persistence, but did show correlations that suggested trends for future research. Lastly, correlations showed that the impact of COVID-19 was negatively associated with many of the predictors, providing possible trends that require further investigation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of further examining the relationship between online learning predictors and the impact of the pandemic, but also suggests directions for institutions, professors, and students to take to improve future online learning outcomes.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:08Z

In plant populations reproducing clonally there may be strong genetic spatial structure. Plant traits vary with environment and genotype so phenotypic traits could possibly indicate clonal identity. As a steppingstone to identify what types of traits best represent clonal identity in Lysimachia terrestris this thesis explores the spatial autocorrelations of floral and vegetative traits, using Moran’s I. Neighbouring plants’ floral traits showed stronger clumping of traits than plant-level vegetative traits, with Moran’s Is around 0.6 until 4 nearest neighbours. Moran’s I steeply decreased with number of neighbours, in traits relating to sexual function, highlighting noticeable trait gradients within neighbourhoods of 15 neighbours. Similar gradients of decreasing Moran’s I were seen over the entire population for traits height filament and style, and flower size. As no environmental or genetic data was available it is still unknown as to if these traits are good indicators of clone identity. This study sets the groundwork for future work with genetic data, acting to route analysis towards the most spatially structured neighbourhood sizes and traits.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:52Z

While it is known that H. deflexa is self-compatible, it is unclear how its selfcompatibility effects its offspring. As well, the self-compatibility status of L. terrestris is currently unknown. This study aims to address these gaps in knowledge. To determine relative seed quality, 223 self- and outcross pollinated H. deflexa seeds were weighed. It was found that there was a borderline
insignificant difference in mean seed mass between the two pollination treatments and a trend towards lower mass seeds in self-pollinated seeds. This suggests that self-pollinated seeds may be of lower quality. To determine the self-compatibility status in L. terrestris, 31 plants at the Sackville Retention Pond were emasculated and hand-pollinated with self or outcross pollen. While the self- and outcross pollination fruit sets were not statistically different, the results suggest that L. terrestris is self-incompatible.  Additionally, the self-compatibility study prompted an investigation into L. terrestris sexual and asexual reproductive traits which revealed that there is spatial structure in the Sackville Retention Pond population.
Overall, there are many aspects of H. deflexa and L. terrestris reproductive biology that we do not understand, but our research has shown that self-pollinated H. deflexa seeds may be of lower quality and that L. terrestris may be selfincompatible. Future studies should investigate the magnitude of inbreeding
depression in self- and outcross pollinated H. deflexa, as well as potential causes for the spatial structure seen in L. terrestris reproductive traits.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:16Z

Conventional catalysts employ transition metals that often have adverse effects on humans, terrestrial and aquatic organisms and ecosystems. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop an effective and environmentally sustainable catalytic complex that is capable of facilitating a two-electron transfer in complex reactions. Bismuth is a viable alternative and candidate for catalysis research as it is less toxic, environmentally benign, and relatively inexpensive. Bismuth, however, is predominantly stable in only the +3- oxidation state, indicative of its limited redox activity. As a remedy, redox active dithiolene ligands may be employed. This allows the metal complex to undergo electron transfer reactions without requiring a change in the oxidation state of the metal center. The goal of this project is to synthesize two molecular arylbismuth dithiolene complexes
[ArBi(dithiolene)], electrochemically characterize their redox potential through cyclic voltammetry, and subsequently test their oxidative potential using diphenyl disulfide. Progress has been made towards the synthesis of the two target compounds [MesBi(L)] (1) and [(4-tBuC6H4)Bi(L)] (2) (L = cis-1,2-dicyano-1,2-ethylenedithiolate). By using a “onepot” synthesis, it is possible to avoid decomposition of the photo- and thermally sensitive RBiCl2 intermediates. Although the formation of both compounds has been suggested via NMR spectroscopy and FT-IR spectroscopy, further purification and characterization of both materials is required.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:03Z

Based on the traditional concept of reinforcement, wheel-running rates were expected to increase close in time before sucrose reinforcement was delivered. Alternatively, there
could be a marked increase in running at the beginning due to a schedule-induced effect of sucrose presentation. Results were not consistent with either prediction. Sucrose reinforcement systematically increased running over the entire 40 revolutions. Possible explanations for this extended reinforcement effect are that wheel running, unlike other operant behaviors, such as lever pressing, generates its own automatic reinforcement effect and is a continuous, rather than a discrete, behavior.

Shifts in cladoceran body size, at both the taxon and assemblage level, can occur as a response to environmental stressors. A standardized body size metric was developed for cladoceran taxa commonly observed in lakes of eastern Canada to provide an assessment method for understanding body size responses to environmental change. The metric was then applied to dated sediment records of five New Brunswick lakes that experienced severe DDT contamination in the mid-20th century. Body sizes of Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp. remains were also measured from two lakes to determine whether size trends based on the metric occurred at a taxon level. A decline in body sizes in two lakes initially associated with historical DDT inputs has remained to present, and suggests that past and contemporary stressors, such as climate change, may structure both assemblage composition and body sizes of cladocerans. The shift towards smaller body sizes during the DDT impact period was reflected at both the assemblage (via the size metric) and taxon levels. The agreement in the metric and
measurements of cladoceran remains from the sediment record suggests that the metric accurately tracks trends in average cladoceran body size through time.

Science fiction is a powerful lens to observe American militarism because science fiction spoke the same language as American politicians and military leaders during the Vietnam war period. Many of the themes, character tropes, symbols, and narrative structures that society generally regards as singularly belonging to the pages of science fiction are actually part of America’s mythology during the Vietnam war. In many respects, the stories of American science fiction are as important as the “city upon a hill” and Manifest Destiny myths to understanding America as an nation, project, and idea. There are so many ideas shared between American science fiction authors and the politicians and military leaders of the United States during the Vietnam War. Because there was so much scientific advancement that occurred between WWII and the start of the Cold War, traditional narrative techniques like journalism that spoke in terms of realism often inadequately addressed topics like technology, warfare and international conflicts. American science fiction literature, whether it supported the Vietnam war or found it immoral and expensive, almost never underestimated America’s actual technological abilities or aggressive foreign policy. During the Vietnam war, American science fiction culture either served as propaganda for the U.S. State, reflecting and cultivating support for America’s doctrine of conquest, or it was politically aware, and stood in opposition to the American war machine. Broadly speaking, American science fiction of the Vietnam war period era articulated either criticism or adulation for America’s techno-fetishism, its cults of the superweapon and the super-soldier, and its resolution to expand its economic influence and geographic jurisdiction.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:55Z

participants were assessed by a research assistant on a series of literacy-related measures concerning phonological awareness, oral vocabulary, and spelling dictation items. At the end of the term, the tutor repeated the spelling dictation task performed prior to intervention. Each tutor performed a pre- and a post-assessment with their student on measures of sight word reading, nonsense word decoding, and spelling ability. The results revealed all literacy areas demonstrated significant improvement over the
intervention period. Moreover, phonological awareness prior to intervention was a significant predictor of relative success in the LINKS program.

The habitat used within each stopover site, and the strategies used to build fat, can vary between species and stopover. In the Canadian Maritimes, the Bay of Fundy has been the focus of migratory shorebird research given the large population of shorebirds it supports. Though less used, other sites on the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia coast, including the Northumberland Strait, also host a diverse shorebird assemblage. A variety of shorebird species use the mudflats, sandflats, and saltmarshes along the Northumberland Strait coast during their fall migration. It is unknown whether species in this region are using the available habitat on a mudflat-by-mudflat basis in this region, and how much fat they are building. We predicted that due to the different pressures associated with long- and short-distance migrations, short-distance migrant species will adhere to a slowly fattening, short stay, many movement strategy, while long-distance migrant species will build fat quickly over a longer period of time with few movements. We investigated duration of stay, habitat use and plasma metabolites of Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla Vieillot), Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla L.), White-rumped Sandpipers (Calidris fuscicollis Vieillot), and Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte) to characterize their use of the Northumberland Strait, and to compare said use between species. Usage of habitat and length of stay were determined through radio telemetry, and plasma metabolites were investigated by measuring plasma triglyceride and B-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Least Sandpipers had the lowest plasma triglyceride and highest B-hydroxybutyrate concentrations suggesting that they were fattening the slowest. Semipalmated Sandpipers and Semipalmated Plovers both had high triglyceride and low B-hydroxybutyrate, while White-rumped Sandpipers occupied an intermediate position with low triglyceride and B-hydroxybutyrate. All sandpiper species in this study had similar mean minimum stopover durations, between 14-19 days, while the plovers stay for up to a week longer. The species also exhibited differences in the habitat they used. Semipalmated Sandpipers ranged more widely than did the other species, though there was a universal preference for habitat nearest to our catching site. These findings provide evidence that shorebirds using the Northumberland Strait are not adhering to the predictions associated with expected stopover behaviour in short- and long-distance migrants. Instead, each species is using unique and variable strategies to build fat stores during their stopover. We also highlight the need for continued research of multiple species stopover strategies and the use of the Northumberland Strait as migratory shorebird habitat as limited movements between sites suggest region wide protection may be needed to conserve shorebirds.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

Furthermore, surface plasmon resonances of gold nanorods can result in the
enhancement of the local electromagnetic field around the nanorods, which in turn amplify the intensities of the Raman signals of molecules absorbed on the gold nanorod surfaces. This
property of gold nanorods allows them to be used in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for potential use in single-molecule detection. Assembling gold nanorods into an ordered
array has been of great interest to many researchers due to the formation of hot spots, or highly localized intense electric fields that can enhance the Raman signal 100 above the 1010–1011 signal enhancement by SERS alone when two gold nanorods are in close proximity to each other. The present work aims to investigate the difference in the Raman signal enhancement when gold nanorods are aligned vertically and horizontally and relate that difference to hot spots generated in tip-to-tip and side-by-side configurations. The Raman signals of rhodamine 6G were enhanced larger when gold nanorods were aligned vertically, which may be caused by differences in the densities of the hot spot and the qualities of enhancement by AuNRV/H substrates. Additionally, computational modeling was used to predict the absorption and scattering properties of a single gold nanorod, as well as to model the hot spots generated by the two configurations.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:47Z

Recently published analytical polyP extraction and enzymatic quantification methods claim to be the “gold standard” for quantitative polyP research but have not yet been tested in species other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The adaptation of these methods for use in the quantification of polyP in phytoplankton was attempted. The molybdenum blue assay, using cloned and expressed exopolyphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.11) and pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) enzymes, very accurately determined the concentration of polyP in a sample after its enzymatic hydrolysis to Pi. Analyte response is largely unaffected by buffer contamination with phenol or chloroform and sample dilution with Milli-Q water. The polyP extraction methods were unsuccessful and not able to replicate the results of the published protocol when attempted on polyP standards or Polysiphonia samples. An older polyP extraction protocol was used to successfully extract polyP from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 but was unable to extract polyP standards. By combining these older extraction methods and newly published enzymatic quantification methods, the concentration of polyP stored within the cells of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria can accurately be measured for future studies, but the cause of the inability of either method to extract polyP standards is still unknown.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:45Z

The Chignecto Isthmus represents a major corridor for the movement of animals and people alike, with a well-documented pattern of wildlife-vehicle collisions, but many unanswered collisions about specific factors during WVCs remain. Ripley’s K analysis was used to determine the scale at which collision clusters occur. This analysis found a scale of 14km across five mobility-based functional groups, these were defined as Birds, Amphibians and Reptiles, Carnivores, Ungulates, and Small-Medium Vertebrates (SMV). The road parameters defined using GIS analysis included traffic volume and driver visibility, while land classification contained Agriculture, Forest, Urban, and Wetland/Water categories. There was insufficient data to test Amphibians and Reptiles, and Carnivores but generalized linear mixed modelling revealed that Ungulates were significantly predicted by topographic driver visibility, SMV by traffic volume and forest land classification, and birds by all land classification types except Water/Wetland. This paper has implications for the protection of the animal movement passages and habitat in the Chignecto Isthmus though increased species-specific management styles and future research may be required in this region.

My corpus includes Fif and Sauvage by Shayne Michael, Overlap by Céleste Godin, and a selection of poems by Xavier Gould. These Acadian writers explore the connections between Acadian and queer identities and issues of language, territory and sovereignty, relations of reciprocity, abjection and embodiment. My analysis of this body of work draws on theoretical insights of Sara Ahmed, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Homi Bhabha, among others. In addi-tion to poststructural discourse analysis, I use a queer linguistics approach, which chal-lenges heteronormativity from a linguistic lens, that is, by examining the various linguistic mechanisms involved in creating queer identities through language, but also how language is part of identity-construction. Queerness is often invisible in Acadian literature, so the purpose of this research is to highlight the importance of paying attention to gender and sexuality as facets of cultural identity.

Overall, this study found that parents of CCCN made several meanings of their caregiving experiences, including but not limited to acceptance, growth, resilience, and finding purpose. As a conclusion of this study, the findings suggest that meaning-making in parents of CCCN likely follows an iterative and ongoing process.

Interestingly, recent findings in visuo-haptic object identification violate this principle: participants who learn to recognize objects haptically perform just as well when asked to identify objects by sight as by touch. One possible explanation is that participants who explore objects haptically visualize the objects they explore, creating a multisensory memory trace equally accessible to vision and touch. I evaluated this possibility by asking healthy undergraduate participants to learn to recognize novel objects either by sight or by touch. Participants completed sequences of learning trials where they explore each object, and test trials where they recall the name of each object. During learning trials, some participants were presented with a visual distractor (half of participants viewed letters and the other half viewed nonverbal characters) they had to recognize later, while other participants completed a distractor-less control condition. Consistent with past findings, my results violated encoding specificity for participants who learned to recognize objects haptically. Interestingly however, only the verbal distractors interfered with learning. These results suggest that the creation of memory representation for novel objects is mediated by a verbal code rather than through visualization.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:13Z

In fact, based on their classification by the IUCN, sturgeon are considered one of the most endangered vertebrate groups worldwide. Therefore, the need for a largescale conservation effort is growing. Cryopreservation is used as a method of preserving important genetic material for conservation purposes by storing biological samples at very low temperatures. Thus, the work presented here is aimed to optimize cryopreservation protocols with a focus on shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) ovarian tissue. Shortnose sturgeon were specifically chosen as they are locally accessible, smaller in size than other sturgeon species, and have a lower endangerment status. I examined the effectiveness of three different cryoprotectants for their use in cryopreserving oogonial cells: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG), and glycerol (GLY). Additionally, the antioxidant melatonin was also included at three different concentrations (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, and 1 mM) in hopes of mitigating freezing injury and enhancing post-thaw cell viability which I assessed using a Luminescent ATP Determination kit. When comparing only the three cryoprotectants without any further supplementation, EG was found to be the least effective cryoprotectant, whereas DMSO was most effective in samples from fish #1 and GLY was most effective in samples from fish #2. However, post-thaw analysis following melatonin supplementation to the cryomedia revealed that there was no one treatment group that stood out from the rest. Alternatively, the four samples with the highest post-thaw ATP concentration all resulted in statistically equal values and were treated with either DMSO + 0.1 mM melatonin, EG + 0.01 mM melatonin, GLY + 0.01 mM melatonin, or GLY without any further supplementation. These results suggest that the addition of melatonin has a favourable effect on viability during the freezing. Overall, the work presented here represents an endeavour to conserve sturgeon populations by using cryopreservation to maintain the integrity and viability of genetic samples.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:43Z

The industry creates 7800 jobs in the Atlantic region, making it a pivotal part of the local economy in rural Atlantic Canada. When lobsters are harvested, they are either sent directly to market, or kept in storage to ensure there is a supply of live lobster available for consumers year-round. The lobster fishery experiences periodic post-harvest loss due to an infection called gaffkemia. Gaffkemia is caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans var. homari. Large live lobster storage facilities have A. viridans screening procedures in place to limit post-harvest loss, but they are not sensitive enough to differentiate between naturally occurring virulent and avirulent strains. When a shipment tests positive for the bacterium, this creates a financial burden on the facility as they must treat the shipment and it must be sold at a lower value. This project hopes to characterize genomes of virulent and avirulent strains of A. viridans var. homari to identify the factors responsible for virulence in this bacterium. This project uses genomic
approaches to identify variations in the genomes of virulent and avirulent strains of A. viridans var. homari. Genomic polymorphisms were compared between the phenotypes and putative virulence factors and impacted metabolic pathways were identified. No pathways had a significantly different number of polymorphisms between the phenotypes.

One of the first anticancer drugs discovered, cisplatin (cis-PtCl2(NH3)2) has had promising results in reducing the proliferation of cancer cells. Millions of patients diagnosed with a range of different cancers have benefited from the use of cisplatin. Even with the benefits, there are a number of major problems involving this drug that have limited its clinical applications, such as acquired drug resistance and cytotoxicity. Consequently, in the last thirty years, analogues of cisplatin complexes have been an important area of research in order to combat these issues. Even though the design is similar, more effective anticancer drugs have been in question. In this study, two novel platinum analogues of cisplatin were prepared. Compound 2a was fabricated by beginning with the synthesis of the bulky and lipophilic ligands which was then added to [PtCl2(cis-cyclooctene)]2 to create the desired platinum compound. Compound 2b, using the same procedure, was successfully synthesized, but with alterations on the ligand (1b). All compounds produced moderate yields and were characterised using 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Detailed analysis of these spectrums concluded that these compounds were successfully synthesized. For this reason, further application of these compounds is promising and with biological testing there may be hope for new and more efficient novel anticancer compounds.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:53Z

Transition metal complexes frequently used in redox catalysis, however, feature toxic metal centers which can be harmful to both human health and the environment. Bismuth has recently been the subject of interest as an alternative to toxic transition metal catalysts as redox non-innocent ligands can be used to make the otherwise redox inactive metal, redox active.

harmful metabolic and physiological effects. Previous research found sucralose activates an 
orphan GPCR, GPR52. Orphan GPCRs lack known functions and endogenous ligands and are 
thus lacking research tools to establish their biological function. The aim of this study was to 
develop tools to study the biological function of GPR52. GPR52 expression in metabolically 
relevant organs in rats was first confirmed by PCR. Three research tools were then explored: 
lentiviral gene knockdown, qPCR, and pharmacological tools. Gene knockdown can be achieved 
via RNAi delivered through a lentiviral expression system. Lentiviral plasmid DNA was 
transfected into cells with shRNA targeting GPR52. After optimizing plasmids and cell health, 
the cells produced lentivirus expressing the shRNA, confirmed by the expression of GFP. 
Functional lentivirus was transduced onto cells to knock down GPR52 expression, confirmed by 
GFP expression. qPCR primers were designed and validated by determining primer efficiency. 
The expression of GPR52 was measured in biologically relevant cell lines, as well as a control of 
HEK293T cells transfected with GPR52 DNA. The qPCR showed off-target amplification and 
the formation of primer dimers when visualized via agarose gel electrophoresis. Pharmacological 
tools like agonists can be used to modulate ligand binding and receptor activation. A novel 
GPR52 agonist, FTBMT, was used to activate GPR52, and was measured via the PRESTO-Tango assay. 
FTBMT treated cells showed morphological changes consistent with cell death, 
and the receptor was not activated. Cell viability when exposed to FTBMT was measured via
MTT assay, which showed no relationship between cell viability and FTBMT treatment. The 
development of these tools is crucial to the study of the biological functions of GPR52 and could 
provide insight on the effects of sucralose on metabolism mediated through the receptor.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z

However, cryopreservation protocols yielding a high post-thaw viability of germ cells are difficult to develop, as there are several interconnected steps that can significantly alter the outcome. The purpose of my study was to optimize the equilibration time for the cryopreservation of zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovarian fragments, since previous studies often neglected this step and instead utilized an arbitrary equilibration time. Using a repeated-measures design, ovarian fragments were exposed to an equilibration treatment (control, 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes in experiment 1; 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes in experiment 2) and cryopreserved via slow-cooling. Post-thaw viability was assessed using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay. A 60 minute equilibration yielded the highest viability of ovarian cells in
experiment 1 (55.68 ± 1.74%), whereas a 30 minute equilibration yielded the highest viability in experiment 2 (75.86 ± 2.44%), but was not significantly different from the 60 minute equilibration in experiment 2 (75.58 ± 2.04%) (p=0.9983). Equilibration as a factor alone accounted for a 48.71% increase in viability, confirming this step should not be overlooked. The method employed in this study can be used to calculate the optimal equilibration time for any fish species, a necessary step in developing effective cryopreservation protocols to preserve the genetic diversity of endangered species.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:55Z

In the looming context of a world war, demonstrating that the
human species is not necessarily progressing towards being more ethical, the rise of logical positivism meant that ethics were no longer considered to be an important part of philosophical
discourse. As a result, moral discussions were dismissed as nonsense. Four female philosophers in particular—Iris Murdoch, Mary Midgley, Philippa Foot, and Elizabeth Anscombe—
understood the dangers of this philosophical climate and shared a concern for objective, moral meaning. They wanted to respond to the loss of ethical concepts they experienced and they each argued (in their own way) that ethical statements can be grounded and objective. As Midgley writes in her memoir:

In varying ways, we all attacked what may be crudely called the boo-hurray view of
ethics—more politely, the idea that facts are split off from values by a logical gap that
makes it impossible to think rationally at all about moral topics. […] ‘Values’ were
treated as a kind of arbitrary opinions [sic], and it was widely held—not only by analytic
philosophers—that, since all people are entitled to their own opinions, argument about
them made no sense.2

Murdoch was particularly concerned about the loss of ethical concepts in understanding one’s own moral stance, and much of her philosophical work focuses on developing or strengthening
our accounts of the moral person. Her work can be characterized as a search for a moral vocabulary that supports the ethical standard of living that she thinks is necessary to live a good
life. In the aftermath of logical positivism, along with the ever-diminishing depth and social importance of the concept of God, Murdoch was searching for a language and collection of ideas that could support her moral convictions.3 Murdoch (and many others) could no longer turn to religious or theological language as a foundational discourse for ethics. In addition to this, the
fact-value distinction that pervades much of analytic philosophy removes value from the sphere of things that can be empirically or objectively known. Here too, ethics loses its grounding in
reality and is left to be a matter of preference. Hence, Murdoch’s work is a search for a new vocabulary, set of concepts, or framework for understanding the world that can ground ethical
ideas.4",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:55Z

The Colavita effect is an instance of multisensory competition whereby we prioritize visual information over auditory information when they are presented simultaneously. Past research has shown the Colavita effect to be a robust phenomenon through resistance to several experimental manipulations. In recent years, researchers have opted to migrate many psychological
studies to online platforms. However, studies of cognitive phenomena present a particular challenge due to their reliance on strict environmental controls. I aimed to examine if the Colavita visual dominance effect would be replicable in an online study. Participants completed a Colavita protocol online and remotely where they were asked to respond to the modality of unimodal (auditory, visual) and bimodal (audiovisual)
stimuli. Bayesian analyses revealed that participants did not respond preferentially to the visual component of audiovisual stimuli, and thus did not show evidence for a Colavita effect. Given past success in finding evidence for visual dominance in traditional laboratory settings and robustness in the literature, the absence of the Colavita effect is likely attributable to both the change in environment and variation in environment between participants.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:25Z

A main mechanism of iron solubilisation is through acid-catalysed reactions in atmospheric aerosol and cloud droplets. In this study the acid-catalysed dissolution of iron in brake wear aerosol was investigated to determine whether brake wear could be an anthropogenic source of WS-Fe. It was found that the iron in brake wear particles becomes soluble when suspended in solutions similar to atmospheric aerosol pH conditions and that the dissolution happens quickly enough to be atmospherically relevant. In solutions of nitric acid and sulphuric acid at pH 1, 2, and 3, 50-100% of available iron was dissolved within 10 hours. The dissolution was found to be very pH dependent, with an approximately 90% decrease in dissolved iron when pH is increased from 1 to 4, suggesting the reaction is highly proton driven. The dissolved iron was speciated and it was found that 75 ± 2.5% was Fe(III) and 25 ± 2.5% was Fe(II) for solutions of sulphuric acid at all pH levels and nitric acid at pH 2-4. However, in nitric acid solutions at pH 1, Fe(II) was completely oxidised into Fe(III). It was found that this oxidation increased with increasing nitrate concentrations at pH 1, suggesting nitrate has a role in the dissolution of iron. These results show that brake wear aerosol could be an important anthropogenic source of WS-Fe in the atmosphere.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:18Z

popes, from the pontificate of Innocent III (r.1198–1216), claimed for themselves absolute sovereignty by divine right.1 Theirs was the most — if not the only — effective centralized
monarchy of medieval Europe, having been developed on the basis of an administrative structure inherited from the old Roman Empire.2 In order to sustain the enormous weight of papal
monarchy, popes began, from the twelfth century, to construct a grand theological and legal edifice of their claims to supremacy.3 They were assisted by theologians and canonists who advocated these new papal claims to untrammelled earthly authority, designated ‘papalists’ or ‘hierocrats’ in what follows.4 Unlike Louis XIV, hierocratic popes conceived their authority as extending not just over the people of a single realm, but over all Christians, and even the entire world. Moreover, they considered their supreme authority to encompass not only temporal affairs, directed toward justice, security, and prosperity in this life, but also the spiritual destiny of every Christian seeking eternal life in heaven. Papalists argued that all positive law depends on the pope for its validity, and that secular rulers and inferior churchmen may only exercise authority on papal sufferance. They likened pontifical authority to the sun, without which the heavens and the earth would be left in utter darkness, thus anticipating the sobriquet afforded to Louis. Sweeping papal authority derives, hierocrats asserted, from the status of each pope as vicar of Christ, the all-powerful Son of God — a status that no pope before the twelfth century, each fashioning himself as the vicar of St. Peter, had dared to assert. In short, hierocratic popes claimed to wield fullness of power (plenitudo potestatis) on earth, and presented that claim as holy dogma.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:20Z

The transition to cancer care under the precision medicine model will require the investigation of novel biomarkers that provide
individualized information about the genetic profiles of particular tumours within a given patient. This study sought to investigate DNA damage response and repair genes, which play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the genome, in cancers of epithelial origin. Given their important role, these genes are potential biomarkers that could indicate whether DNA damage is being repaired adequately; where both a lack of or an increase in response could result in cancer. To investigate their potential as biomarkers, two types of DNA damage-related genes were investigated in this study. First, the ability of the status of mismatch repair genes to be used with the status of MAPK pathway oncogenes, as combined biomarkers, to predict survival probability was examined retrospectively using a database from a rural population in New Brunswick, Canada. Both Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox Proportional Hazards Regression analyses were performed. Next, the Translesion Synthesis E3 ubiquitin ligase, RAD18, was investigated as a potential biomarker in lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry was performed in autopsy samples from an individual donor, and a protocol for subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was created using a control primer set with the experimental samples. The results found that combined mismatch repair gene and oncogene biomarkers were not as powerful as previously described, with other covariates such as biological sex having more predictive power. For RAD18, there did not appear to be a qualitative difference in the amount of RAD18 across tumour samples and normal lung tissue. Overall, further studies with larger sample sizes and quantitative methods will be needed to verify the findings from this study.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:06Z

In this study the effects of taurine deficiency on cardiac function in brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, was assessed in vivo using intraarterial pressure measurements and metabolite assays. We hypothesized that by feeding brook trout a diet containing β-alanine, a competitive inhibitor of taurine transporter (TauT), that differences in heart function would be discovered when compared to fish fed a control diet. The study incorporated two treatment groups, a group of brook trout fed pellets vacuum coated in β-alanine to decrease intracellular taurine concentrations and a group of brook trout fed a standard diet. This study found that brook trout who had been fed the taurine depleting β-alanine diet had similar blood pressure, heart rate and chase-to-exhaustion times as brook trout fed standard diets. A significant decrease (p=0.023) in pulse pressure was observed in brook trout fed the taurine depleting β-alanine diet.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) was ratified by a coalition of global powers in 1989, and its jurisdiction was later ratified in 2002 by the Rome Statute.3 The lofty vision of the ICC has focussed on a brand of justice that holds those who have committed the worst atrocities known to man accountable for their actions in an imprisonment setting in The Hague, Netherlands.4 This conceptualization of a globalized justice system stems from a collectively held ideology that there is a framework in place
for this type of justice; one that is to some extent supposed to be restorative. The ICC champions that it is for the benefit of all nations against the horrors that have been committed in the last century. This thesis aims to look at the intended efficacy of the ICC; how and why nations use the ICC to their advantage; the argument of how the ICC can be used as an extension of the security systems built and funded by the Global North in an act of neo-colonial paternalism; and how the ICC is being used as a modern political tool in the cases that it chooses to prosecute.
The ICC will be explored through a critical analysis lens that prioritizes restorative justice mechanisms that are practiced and welcomed, and seen continuously to fruition by those who have directly experienced the violence that the ICC contents to resolve. In so far, the ICC has brought forward seventeen cases to trail, with a now dwindling membership of 123 countries as signatories to the functioning international legal recourse clause that is the Rome Statute.5 As argued by Hillebrecht in Who Pursues the Perpetrators? State Cooperation with the ICC, the scope, mechanisms, and efficacy of this international court is used as that of an “international legal lasso.”6 This means that instead of directly serving the needs, wants, and systems of justice as wanted by the survivors of the most horrific acts known to humankind, the ICC is operating under the disposition, needs, and wants, of western conceptualizations of justice and neo-colonial paternalist practices.7 
The following three chapters will appear in this order: Theoretical Approaches to International Justice; Mechanisms and Critical Analysis of the ICC; Case Studies - Uganda and Sudan. Theoretical Approaches to International Justice provides a foundational understanding of a series of political, judicial, and socio-economic epistemologies grounded in decolonial texts and contexts. This will allow the reader to have an solid understanding of the critiques that will be used throughout the thesis to demonstrate where the ICC, as an institution that aims to restore justice and peace, fails to do either. Mechanisms and Critical Analysis of the ICC will be an exploration, as stated directly in the title takes the critiques of the international judicial system as it stands currently, and applies this to the function and judicial mechanisms of the ICC as they directly interact with the global stage. Through this chapter, there will be an exploration into the conceptualization of the Court and the Rome Statute along with an analysis of the relationship, or rather, lack thereof, between the International Criminal Court and the United States of America. Finally, the analysis will demonstrate the critiques of the ICC through an analysis of two cases called to the court, Uganda and Sudan, by analysing them through the methodologies and concepts discussed in the
previous two chapters along with a summarizing paragraph in order to solidify a grounded understanding of the critiques and analysis presented on the scope and efficacy of the International Criminal Court.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:40Z

The DMH functionally connects thermoreceptors in the skin to the sympathetic nervous system, which activates BAT and generates heat during cold exposure in mammals. While it is known that the DMH is essential for BAT activation, how cold exposure affects neuronal communication and excitability in the DMH remains unknown. We hypothesized that cold exposure affects synaptic communication in the DMH by altering glutamate transmission and neuronal excitability. To examine the potential effects of cold exposure on DMH synapses, we subjected young male Sprague Dawley rats to a two-hour cold exposure (2 - 4°C). To control for the effects of stress during cold exposure experiments, control (stress) experiments were performed with replicated procedures excluding the change in temperature. Patch clamp electrophysiology was then used to study glutamate signaling and excitability in the DMH of naive, cold-exposed, and stressed animals. We observed a decrease in baseline glutamate transmission in the DMH of cold exposed animals. This suggests that decreased glutamate transmission in the DMH may be involved in signaling cold temperatures and activating thermogenic processes regulated by the DMH. A long-term depression at glutamate synapses was observed in the DMH of both cold-exposed and stressed animals. As the long-term depression was also seen in stressed animals, who experienced similar environmental manipulation without a change in temperature, the observed depression was likely caused by stress and not cold exposure. There was no difference in action potential firing observed across naive, cold-exposed, and stressed animals, suggesting a two-hour cold exposure does not alter the excitability of DMH neurons. This study is the first to demonstrate that glutamate transmission is decreased in the DMH during cold exposure, representing a potential important neuronal mechanism involved in activating thermoregulatory strategies such as BAT thermogenesis.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:48Z

Nectar spurs generally affect the mechanical fit between
plants and their pollinators because they restrict nectar access to animals with long-tongues or strong mouth parts. Nectar spurs are therefore an important floral trait that can shape species’ pollination ecology. Halenia deflexa’s pollination ecology, however, has not been documented and it is unclear whether the species has any insect pollinators at all. I aimed to determine the principal pollinators of H. deflexa. During summer 2019, I observed patches of H. deflexa for ~40 hours total to document visitation by pollinators. I found the species to be visited almost exclusively by bumblebees (Bombus sp.), including the endangered B. terricola (yellow banded bumblebee). The likelihood of visitation by Bombus sp. decreased every day before coming to a complete stop after August 7. I found that the total amount of time that a Bombus visitor spent foraging from a single plant, per patch, increased with the number of open flowers on a plant. Throughout the summer, I also noticed that spur length of H. deflexa decreased from the first and last flowers on a plant and I quantified this change in 16 marked individuals. Last, I found that reductions in spur length coincided with reductions in visitation by bumblebees. This work does
not determine whether changes in pollinator behavior are influenced by spur length. It does, however, feature some novel observations of H. deflexa and demonstrate the importance of flower shape in a plant–pollinator system.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:56Z

All receptors were activated by the 4/8X mixture except GPR37L1, which, following treatments with individual amino acids, its decrease in signaling was attributed to L-Arg with a fold change of 0.70. The remaining receptors were all significantly activated by L-Phe. In the case of GPR12, GPR84, and GPR88, activation by L-Phe surpassed that of the 4/8X amino
acid mixture with fold changes of 2.66, 2.56, and 5.35, respectively, suggesting possible competitive inhibition during the 4/8X treatment. These results suggest that, through activation of GPCRs, L-Phe may play a much more significant role in metabolic processes than once thought. Determination of the biological relevance of this signaling may one day present a great therapeutic potential for future drug discovery.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:14Z

For short-term hypoxic exposures, teleost fish may rely on anaerobic glucose metabolism via glycolysis, however given the limited glycogen stores in these animals glucose will not be sufficient to survive over the long-term. The substrate that they use to tolerate chronic hypoxic exposures is currently unknown, but amino acids, ketone bodies, or lipids are possible. Ketone bodies may be preferable due to the low oxygen cost, production efficiency, and potential anti-oxidative effects. The purpose of my research was to investigate if teleost fish are capable of metabolizing ketone bodies during exposures to chronic hypoxia. Using brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) as our model organism, we placed fish in 50% dissolved oxygen for 24-hours as an acute exposure and 9-days as a chronic exposure, and compared these to control fish and those that were starved for 9 days. After treatment I took blood, heart, liver, and white muscle samples and performed assays to assess ketone activity. Liver glycogen decreased significantly following chronic hypoxia, suggesting that glucose stores were depleted. The activity of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase was unaffected by exposure to hypoxia and similarly, I observed no changes in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate.
However, plasma acetoacetate decreased significantly following chronic hypoxia, which may be due to increased uptake into tissues. Activity of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT) increased in the heart after chronic hypoxia, but SCOT was decreased in white muscle after both acute and chronic hypoxia. This suggests that ketogenic responses are tissue-specific, and that the heart may utilize ketones to maintain a steady ATP source. In conclusion, this research suggests that S. fontinalis is capable of partial ketogenic responses during chronic hypoxia and this may help to support ATP production in obligate organs like the heart.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:39Z

This study examines the distribution and abundance of suspected microplastics in surface water samples from two rivers in rural watersheds of New Brunswick, Canada. Both rivers are subject to point sources of microplastic input from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as diffuse inputs from the atmosphere, surface-water runoff, and human activities. The Kennebecasis is more developed than the Nashwaak, with a greater number of WWTPs and increased human activities. Surface water samples from the rivers were collected at sites upstream and downstream of WWTP effluent discharge points and at intermediate sites spaced evenly along the river stretches sampled. Suspected MPs were present at all sites and 72% were blue-coloured fibres. Surface water samples from the Kennebecasis contained a greater abundance of suspected MPs compared to those from the Nashwaak (p = 0.03). Suspected MP abundance was significantly higher downstream of four WWTPs compared to upstream (p = 0.03) and intermediate sites (p = 0.02). Results help understand the input, transport, and fate of MPs in rivers from watersheds with low population density. These findings are an important first step in establishing the scope of MP contamination within freshwaters from Atlantic Canada.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:57Z

The blacklegged tick is also the primary vector of Lyme Disease, the most common vector borne disease in North America. Climate is believed to have co‐driven this expansion as temperature has been found to be a strong predictor of tick occurrence. Previous research within the literature has shown that that the known geographic range of the I. scapularis is less than what its habitat requirements allow, especially temperature, and thus it is thought that it will expand its geographic range. This study used data from the Lloyd Tick Lab, a passive surveillance program, over an eight‐year period to assess if any spatial or temporal trends of the tick in New Brunswick, Canada could be identified. Comparison was completed to assess the closeness to predictions found in the literature. Results indicated the development of two areas of high tick recoveries per capita, upriver of the Saint John River as well as a spread laterally (southwest to northeast) between the counties of Saint John and Westmoreland. These results closely followed recent predictions in the literature and yield important information as to the spread of the blacklegged tick in New Brunswick. This study indicates that model predictions for the near future (2020’s) are supported by the most recent tick recovery trends and provide important confirmation of the trajectory of species range expansion.

In the brain, the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) plays an important role in the regulation of appetite. Cholecystokinin (CCK), an important neuropeptide and satiety hormone acts in the DMH to suppress food intake. Although the exact mechanisms by which CCK inhibits food intake are not entirely understood, there is evidence that CCK alters neurotransmitter release onto DMH neurons. Specifically, CCK increases the release of the major inhibitory transmitter, GABA, onto putative appetite-stimulating DMH neurons. It is unknown, however, whether CCK affects the transmission of glutamate, a major excitatory transmitter, despite reports of CCK modulating glutamate release elsewhere in the brain. We hypothesized that CCK decreases neuronal activity and glutamate transmission in DMH neurons in rats. To test this hypothesis. we used young male Sprague Dawley rats and performed patch clamp electrophysiology to record action potentials and glutamate-mediated currents in living DMH neurons. Surprisingly, CCK had no effect on evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents, even following a high-frequency stimulation (HFS) into the extracellular space, causing increased neurotransmitter release. There was, however, a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous events following HFS in the presence of CCK, suggesting that CCK is involved in facilitating glutamate transmission. Another satiety hormone, leptin, has been reported to act in combination with CCK to reduce appetite when co-injected into other regions of the brain. We therefore co-administered CCK and leptin onto DMH brain slices. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in glutamate transmission following bath application, however, following HFS, there were no significant effects. There were also no significant changes in the spontaneous activity of these DMH neurons. We then administered leptin alone to determine whether the decrease in glutamate transmission was a direct result of leptin, or if CCK and leptin act together to modulate transmission. No effect was observed following bath application of leptin alone. There was also no significant change following high-frequency stimulation, but there was a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous currents in the presence of leptin. These results suggest that CCK and leptin act synergistically in the DMH to modulate food intake via decreased glutamate transmission at DMH neurons. This research could provide important information regarding the mechanisms by which CCK and leptin suppress appetite in rats, with implications for humans living with obesity.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:06Z

This ability for PM2.5 to induce oxidative stress is known as its toxicity and is referred to as oxidative potential (OP). This poses a serious health risk for the ~3 billion people globally who continue to rely on biomass burning for their cooking needs as it is a significant source of indoor PM2.5. To combat the problem associated with traditional biomass burning cookstoves, ‘improved’ biomass burning cookstoves have been developed which have been shown to reduce the mass of PM2.5 generated. However, it is unknown whether the overall exposure to toxic chemicals contained in PM2.5 is reduced using these cookstoves as the adverse health effects of PM2.5 are better linked with OP than mass of PM2.5 inhaled. The goals of this study were to determine whether the OP of PM2.5 emitted from improved cookstoves was reduced and to determine what effect fuel type has on the OP of PM2.5. To test this, 4 fuel types (2 wood types and 2 charcoal types) were burned in 5 cookstoves (2 traditional and 3 improved) using the simmer-phase of the Water Boiling Test protocol to generate PM2.5 samples that were collected on quartz filters for analysis. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was employed to determine the OP of the PM2.5 and was split into 2 fractions, the water-soluble (WS) and total fraction. The DTT activity values were corrected using two variables, mass (OP(DPP/Mass)) and volume (OP(DPP/Volume)). The mass emitted from the 3 improved cookstoves were found to significantly reduce PM2.5 compared to the traditional stoves, consistent with previous studies. (OP(DPP/Volume)) was found to be more representative of the overall exposure to toxic PM2.5 emitted during a cooking event as it accounts for both intrinsic OP of the PM2.5 (toxicity per mass of PM2.5) and the mass emission of PM2.5. The (OP(DPP/Volume)) values were compared for all cooking methods and the wood fuel types were found to have the greatest (OP(DPP/Volume)) for each cookstove. Using the experimentally determined (OP(DPP/Volume)), example mitigation strategies were then suggested. Given the option to only switch cookstove or fuel type from the 3-stone with hardwood cooking method, a greater reduction in (OP(DPP/Volume)) can be achieved by switching from wood to coal (84% reduction) rather than 3-stone to improved stove (62% reduction). WS data was found to vary in its contribution to the total (OP(DPP/Volume)) from less than 15% to just below 75%, suggesting that the chemical composition of components that contributed to the OP of PM2.5 is dependent on cooking method.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:06Z

Participants were 9 men, 28 women, and 1 person who was genderqueer/fluid. All participants were from a small undergraduate university who participated in focus groups to discuss casual sex. We found that there was a common understanding that casual sex could be defined as the absence of “normal” relationship components, and that there was a heavy “pre-hookup script” involved in university hookup culture. Participants were aware of key barriers to positive experiences, such as gender double standards, emotional/physical risks, and others.

The hippocampus also supports some form of spatial processing, and some have suggested that the decline of spatial processing as early as perception could underly episodic memory deficits. However, to date, no one has investigated spatial processing in older adulthood without the confound of long-term memory demands. I therefore examined age-related differences in spatial perception by having 29 participants complete a novel spatial task that minimized memory demands. The sample comprised 15 younger adults (Mage = 25; SD = 5.75) and 14 older adults (Mage = 64; SD = 3.77). Participants compared screenshots of 3D virtual rooms to simultaneously presented 2D room layouts and indicated whether the rooms were identical or not. My results indicated no age-related difference in  accuracy scores on either location or object-based trials. However, older adults spent significantly longer on location-based trials than younger adults did. These results suggest that healthy older adults exhibit subtle age-related deficits in spatial processing, even at perception. My findings support theories proposing that an age-related deficit in spatial processing may cause episodic memory problems in older adults.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:52Z

Many of these species are declining, including the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), a Nearctic breeding migratory shorebird that refuels in Atlantic Canada during southbound migration. The origin of Semipalmated Sandpiper’s population declines is not fully understood as these declines have not been identified as widespread or isolated to a specific Arctic breeding region. Currently, bill lengths are used as a proxy for breeding origin as Semipalmated Sandpiper bill length increases from west to east across the Arctic. However, bill length relationships confound with sex as females have longer bills than males. Therefore, deuterium (δ2H) signatures were used to track the breeding origin of juvenile Semipalmated Sandpipers. To elucidate the migratory connectivity of Semipalmated Sandpipers refueling in the Northumberland Strait and the Bay of Fundy we examined (1) the relationship between deuterium signature and bill length, (2) the origin of Semipalmated Sandpipers, (3) the relationship between breeding origin and timing of migration, (4) differences in breeding origin between years and refueling sites, and (5) the relationship between breeding origin and the amount of time spent refueling. We captured juvenile shorebirds on Maritime staging locations. We obtained blood samples for molecular sexing as well as feather samples for stable isotope analysis. We found that, though the relationships between migration timing and breeding origin varied among years, the proportional origins of birds did not change. Most birds are arriving from the eastern and central regions of the Arctic. Birds associated with an unusually early arrival in 2019 were from more southeastern breeding populations. Conversely, early arriving birds in 2018 came from more western and northern sites. Semipalmated Sandpiper arriving from more eastern and southern breeding populations had longer stopover durations in 2019. Climate on Arctic breeding grounds correlated with migratory timing. Colder temperatures and slightly later snowmelt in 2018 related to an earlier migration from northern and western breeding birds. Additionally, cooler temperatures, more precipitation, and earlier snowmelt in most southern and eastern breeding populations suggested more success and earlier migration for these populations in 2019. A large implication of this study is that stable isotope analysis of feathers will allow us to identify approximate breeding origin of birds staging in Maritime Canada. We look forward to assessing long-term trends and proportional breeding origin changes as additional years of data are obtained.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:42Z

Eastern breeding Sandpipers use sites in Atlantic Canada, such as Petit-Cap, NB, to prepare for migration to South America. Rates of mass gain are an important metric used to predict migratory success and assess site quality, although this is difficult to obtain given that it requires the recapture of individual birds, which is not feasible at many staging sites. Plasma metabolites are a useful tool for indicating these metabolic changes in mass over time, but these relationships have not been examined in freeliving Semipalmated Sandpipers, despite their widespread use in the literature. At the study site, Petit-Cap, recaptures are possible, allowing us to test this relationship. 
We examined plasma metabolites (plasma triglycerides, glycerol, and bhydroxybutyrate) in relation to changes in mass in recaptured Semipalmated Sandpipers at Petit-Cap, NB. We failed to detect relationships between plasma triglycerides and b-hydroxybutyrate and mass changes in recaptured Semipalmated Sandpipers, suggesting that inferences of mass changes through plasma metabolites
should not be integrated over long time intervals. We did find a significant positive relationship between glycerol and mass gain. As an extension of studying migratory refueling, we also assessed diets of the shorebirds while staging at this site. We found that bivalves were contributing largely to diets of both adult and juvenile Semipalmated Sandpipers, with no significant differences in diet breadth between the
two age classes.
While collecting data for this study, we encountered a storm midway through the staging season. This provided an opportunity to examine the effects of short-term weather events upon body condition and refueling in staging Semipalmated Sandpipers. We found significant impacts upon migratory refueling in both recaptured and non-recaptured Semipalmated Sandpipers following a storm. Recaptured birds, on
average, lost mass during the week following the storm. Similarly, non-recaptured birds had significantly lower size adjusted masses during versus before or after the week of the storm. These findings support previous research on the sensitivity of staging shorebirds to environmental fluctuations and highlight the importance of considering weather events a threat to migratory refueling. 
We emphasize the need for further investigation into the relationships between plasma metabolites, diet, handling, and weather upon rates of migratory refueling in Semipalmated Sandpipers.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:07Z

current study aimed to identify the impacts of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) capped 5 nm silver

and tissue samples taken. Biological endpoints analyzed included hematocrit, gill sodium
potassium ATPase, heart acetylcholinesterase, and cortisol and malondialdehyde content.
Fractional rates of protein synthesis were determined by flooding dose method modified to use a
stable phenylalanine isotope tracer. No significant differences were observed between treatment
groups for any of the biologically relevant endpoints nor protein synthesis rates, although a
decreasing trend was observed for sodium potassium ATPase activity in nAg-exposed fish. Results
suggest that rainbow trout exposed to silver ENMs for 48 hours at the environmentally relevant
point-source exposure concentration tested are not expressing signs of significant damage nor
exhibiting impaired metabolism indicating that under short term conditions 5 nm PVP-capped nAg
at 100 μg L-1 is not acutely toxic. These findings are disputable as previous research has

Interruptions in the fixed
bout of reinforcement occurred after rats completed different numbers of wheel revolutions and were designed to vary the local constraint on wheel running, while
holding constant the total number of revolutions per session, the overall constraint. Eleven female Long-Evans rats responded on response-initiated variable interval 15-s
schedules for the opportunity to run for 30 revolutions, with a 4.5-s wheel-brake asserted after 2, 5, 10 or 15 revolutions. After the brake disruption, rats had to complete the
remainder of the 30-wheel turns required for the bout of wheel-running reinforcement. Results showed that wheel-running rates and overall lever-pressing rates followed a
bitonic, inverted-U function for wheel revolutions completed before the 4.5-s interruption. These results suggest that interruptions of wheel-running within a reinforcement opportunity systematically altered wheel-running rates and lever-pressing rates. Notably, similar effects have been obtained when local constraint is manipulated as the number of wheel revolutions per reinforcement. Interruptions of wheel running within fixed bouts of wheel-running reinforcement, however, produced weaker effects than local constraint based on the number of revolutions per reinforcement, likely due to the wheel revolutions after the disruption which were required to complete each reinforcement. In sum, these results support an account based on local constraint on an automatically reinforced behavior rather than reinforcement magnitude to explain how wheel-running and lever-pressing rates change with revolutions per reinforcement.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:13Z

Although the environmental impacts of microfibers are not well-understood, they are suspected to play a role in the dispersal of chemicals and other contaminants throughout aquatic systems and may impair feeding and respiration of aquatic filter-feeding organisms due to their tendency to accumulate on digestive and respiratory tissues. This study aimed to determine whether freshwater mussels in the Saint John River watershed acquire microfibers on or within their tissues, and if so, whether microfiber abundance was related to WWTP discharge points and other potential diffuse microfiber sources. Microfiber abundance was assessed in mussels of the species Margaritifera margaritifera L., which were collected both upstream and downstream of WWTP discharge points and at intermediate sampling points along the Kennebecasis and Tobique rivers. No spatial trends were observed in microfiber abundance in relation to WWTP discharge on either river. Mussels from the Tobique River had significantly (p < 0.01) more microfibers per gram of soft tissue than those from the Kennebecasis.

To address this, 51 undergraduate students were tested on their reading speed and spelling accuracy to confirm the association between these abilities and to examine the effect of the location of spelling errors within a word on reading speed as an explanation for this relationship. At present, it is uncertain how error location may affect reading, as different theories lead to different predictions in this respect: some theories suggest that errors in the middle of a word may be more detrimental to reading speed than errors at the beginning, and others propose the reverse. Participants were tested on 25 words, each presented three times. Reading speed was measured using SuperLab 5.0 and spelling accuracy was measured using handwritten spelling tests. A within participant analysis confirmed that words that were spelled correctly all three times were read faster than words that were never spelled correctly.

G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of transmembrane receptors, are critical for the cellular communication needed to coordinate processes involved in energy homeostasis (e.g. food intake). Indeed, metabolites are thought to act as sensors of energy stores by activating GPCRs in order to regulate energy homeostasis.

It was found that a mixture of 19 essential and non-essential amino acids significantly activated 14 lipid metabolism GPCRs. Of these, MC4, DP2, GPBA, S1P1, and S1P4 were chosen for further investigation and were found to be significantly activated by 0.8 mM L-Phenylalanine. This finding suggests L-Phenylalanine may play a more prominent role as a signalling molecule at GPCRs regulating energy homeostasis than previously thought. This aids in elucidating the satiating mechanisms of high protein diets and has important implications for research into diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:56Z

of carbon dioxide. As climate change intensifies and as cities face the impacts of climate 
change, urban climate planning becomes all the more important. In addition, climate 
change impacts are felt unequally on both global and local scales, along the lines of 
existing structural inequalities. Terms such as “climate justice” have emerged to address 
these inequalities and to emphasize that climate change has social justice implications in 
both its causes and impacts. While these terms have been used in activist circles for some 
time, it is more recently that academic and policy language has incorporated a nuanced 
understanding of climate change as a social issue. This paper examines urban planning in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, with a focus on whether Halifax plans incorporate climate justice. 
This is done through an analysis of the HalifACT 2050 climate plan from 2020 and the 
Regional Municipal Planning Strategy from 2014, as well as interviews with key 
informants on planning processes in Halifax. The research reveals that a consideration of 
climate justice is beginning to emerge within the last three to four years, but that there are 
still potential areas for improvement, such as specifically addressing structural inequality 
and setting out clear actions to address climate injustice",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:39Z

Both neurotransmitters can act presynaptically to regulate GABA and glutamate transmission. Previous studies have shown an interaction between NO and eCB signaling. NO prevented eCB-mediated decrease in glutamate transmission in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH). Furthermore, another study within the DMH found that NO was required for eCB-mediated decrease in GABA transmission. There is little research, however, on the mechanism behind the interactions between eCBs and NO. The DMH has been a major focus for research due to its importance in appetite regulation. We aimed to determine how NO affects eCB signaling at glutamatergic synapses in the rat DMH. We hypothesized that NO affects eCB-mediated decrease in glutamate transmission through an NMDA, and cGMP, -dependent pathway. To test our hypothesis, male Sprague Dawley rats were used as subjects, and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings were taken at glutamate synapses in live DMH neurons. Our results show that NO disrupts eCB-mediated depression through an NMDA receptor-dependent pathway. Additionally, we further targeted the NO pathway and concluded that NO is likely affecting eCB signaling from the postsynaptic cell. We also performed an experiment targeting CB1R activation by an agonist. Previous data showed that activation of CB1Rs by an agonist significantly decreased glutamate release. We repeated this experiment in the presence of L-arginine, a NO precursor, and observed that the agonist was still able to decrease glutamate signaling. Finally, we wanted to determine if NO is affecting short-term eCB signaling. Previous research has suggested that NO does not affect short-term synaptic plasticity at glutamate synapses in the hippocampus. Our data was consistent with this as we did not see a change in short-term glutamate transmission. Overall, figuring out how these two retrograde neurotransmitters interact to affect synaptic transmission can extend well beyond appetite regulation as these neurotransmitters are ubiquitously produced at synapses in various parts of the brain.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:07Z

A well-documented phenomenon in humans, the present study investigated the potential presence of an undermining effect of extrinsic sucrose reinforcement on intrinsically motivated (automatically-reinforced) operant wheel running in eight female Long-Evans rats. In each session, rats ran for 20 min prior to and following operant wheel running on a fixed interval (FI) 60-s schedule. Across three conditions, water, sucrose, and water were delivered as outcomes for operant wheel running on the FI 60-s schedule. No undermining effect was observed for wheel running on the FI 60-s schedule following the removal of sucrose; nor was there a decrease in running during the 20-min post-operant running period. However, wheel running during the 20 min period prior to operant running significantly decreased. Contrary to previous findings, this result suggests that an undermining effect can occur in rats. Explanations for the presence of this effect as well as suggestions for future research investigating this effect in non-human species are discussed.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:47Z

The environments created appear to favour the growth of cyanobacteria in comparison to other primary producers. The smallest group of these organisms, known as picocyanobacteria, is uniquely adapted to grow and dominate aquatic environments following a period of nutrients saturation. Due to the small nature of these organisms’ identification outside of genomic testing can be a difficult task, as such minor morphological differences can be hard to identify using microscopic techniques. Despite being closely related and similarly classified, many picocyanobacteria have been highly specialized in their environment based on conditions such as salinity, nutrient availability, and light. This study implemented the use of a high-throughput well plate design to expose three strains of picocyanobacteria to a fully crossed experimental matrix of five phosphorus concentrations (0 μM, 0.5 μM, 3.0 μM, 5.0 μM, and 7.0 μM), four nitrogen concentrations (0 μM, 5.0 μM, 30.0 μM, and 70.0 μM), and three-light levels (30, 100 or 300 μmol photons m-2 s-1), to determine if niche determination based on nutrients and light is an effective method of understanding and characterizing the growth of picocyanobacteria strains. Cyanobium sp. CZS25K, Cyanobium sp. CZS48M, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were examined for this study. Statistical modelling demonstrated distinct strain-specific variations between the uses of nutrients and light for
growth. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were demonstrated to influence the growth of CZS25K. Nitrogen and light levels were essential for the growth of CZS48M. In contrast, PCC6803 growth rates were most sensitive to environmental nitrogen availability. These results may help support and inspire studies examining phytoplankton growth and adaptation mechanisms. This knowledge is becoming increasingly valuable for global monitoring and management of accelerated phytoplankton growth.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:03Z

The severity and duration of hypoxic exposures is also increasing, leading to major challenges for aquatic organisms. These organisms must find ways to survive these conditions, and many rely on a reduction in energy demands or metabolic reorganization. During an acute hypoxic exposure, there is a switch from aerobic ATP production to anaerobic glycolysis, which relies on adequate glycogen stores. We do know that glycogen stores can become depleted following chronic hypoxia, therefore, these organisms must rely on an alternative source of fuel. These may be lipids, amino acids, or ketone bodies, but it is currently unclear which is being used. There have been few studies on the potential use of lipids as a fuel source as there is evidence to suggest they are mobilized during chronic hypoxia. To understand if lipids are being used during chronic hypoxia, brook trout, a hypoxia sensitive species, were exposed to acute (24 hours) and chronic (9 days) hypoxia. Following the treatment, we examined the levels of glycogen in heart, liver, and muscle tissue and found it to be decreased in muscle and liver tissues. Seeing these declines in glycogen stores suggests that another fuel is being used. We examined plasma triglycerides and found decreases in the plasma suggesting that they are being taken up by the tissues or lipids are being circulated in another form during hypoxia. Finally, we examined lipid ß-oxidation in the tissues and found it to be increased in the liver where glycogen stores had been depleted. The results show some evidence for the use of lipids as an energy source during chronic hypoxia.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:33:06Z

The main source of primary production in mudflats is microphytobenthos. Biotic and abiotic factors affect the abundance of microphytobenthos and ultimately the energy that most of the ecosystem relies on. The effect of bottom-up and top-down factors on mudflat ecosystems have been studied in the past. However, due to the complex overlapping trophic roles in the ecosystem, identifying factors that influence microphytobenthos abundance can be difficult. Previous studies have examined bottom-up and top-down factors, but have either investigated only top-down, or both bottom-up and top-down but without considering all predators known to be important. There is lack of research on the combined effect of known important bottom-up and top-down factors. We investigated the effect of nutrient availability and key predators on microphytobenthos abundance. A manipulative field experiment involving a combination of fertilizer addition and predator exclusion was performed in Grande Anse, in the Bay of Fundy in summer 2020. Fertilizer increased microphytobenthos abundance throughout the experiment, four weeks after application. A seasonal pattern in biofilm abundance was observed with a decrease in abundance form early July to late July and an increase from late July to late August. We found that mudsnails, which were present in low densities in this system, increased microphytobenthos abundance. We suggest bioturbation from mudsnails’ grazing stimulated nutrient recycling and increased microphytobenthos production. Mudsnails were more abundant in fertilized sites, as well as where birds could forage as compared to where birds were excluded. We propose that the increased presence of mudsnails where birds could forage could be attributed to bird droppings and surface disturbances, stimulating microphytobenthos production. Apart from mudsnails, invertebrate communities did not affect microphytobenthos abundance, but there were individual group responses to fertilizer and predation. In late August, Corophium volutator were more abundant in unfertilized, snail- and bird-excluded sites, and bivalves were less abundant in bird-included sites, regardless of fertilizer treatment. In late July, nematode abundance was higher in fertilized sites than unfertilized. These findings broaden our understanding of ecological factors that affect microphytobenthos abundance, and of mudflat ecology as whole.",,"Submitted by Rachel Wang (rachel.wang@utoronto.ca) on 2024-12-16T14:32:50Z

Sperm are commonly collected for in vitro fertilization, quality assessment, and research purposes. Sperm cells have incredibly short lifespans which make it difficult for use in aquaculture management and in research. For that reason, it is essential to develop methods for optimal short-term storage of semen. Short-term storage of semen involves temporary cooling of sperm cells (>0 oC), which reduces the metabolic rate and thus extends the lifespan of the cell. That being said, sperm are vulnerable to desiccation as they are highly packed in seminal plasma. Diluents function to reduce the potential for dehydration and decrease sperm density while preventing activation. Extenders are added to semen to mitigate sperm cell damage when stored in cooler temperatures while supplying nutrients to the cells. This is particularly important for work on external fertilizing freshwater fish. Fortunately, there are a variety of diluents and extenders that have already been developed and tested on a variety of freshwater fish species. There has been no work currently done on Blue Tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) in this area. Blue Tilapia are a very important fish for aquaculture and in our lab. The goal of my honours research is to fill this gap and determine if we can successfully store Blue Tilapia semen. I collected semen samples from Blue Tilapia males, diluted it with HBSS, and left samples in the fridge for varying amounts of time. I then examined the effects of the length time in the fridge on sperm percent motility, and swimming velocity. I found that the velocity of spermatozoa of Tilapia in HBSS is not impacted by time in the fridge up to 18 hours.

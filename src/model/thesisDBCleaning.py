So since we in the future we want to be able to add MLA & Chicago citations, it's important that we find the commonalities amongst all citations:
First Name, Last Name, Title, Year are all variables that are important to each citation style
Institution, Thesis & Database are common amongst the three but will be hard coded since

Names:  dc.contributor.author
Title:  dc.title
Year:   dc.date.issued


Unfortunately the data isn't super clean 

dc.contributor.author: need to abbreviate first and middle names to initials 
dc.title: capitalize first letter of title and subtitle, proper nouns (actually, Iâ€™ll just work on cleaning these so you can take them directly). 
dc.date.issued: need to get year only (dates are still a bit messy).

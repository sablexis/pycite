# pycite
creating citations from a csv dataset to quickly process a collection of underground theses for the Mount Allison University Library

## Project Overview
Our goal with this project was to automate a tedious task in order to make it easier for others to cite all the wonderful undergraduate research conducted here at Mount Allsion University! By piping in an existing dataset of all our digitally available theses, create an additional column with correctly formatted APA, MLA, Chicago citations.

## How to Run This Script
by clicking the green code button at the top right of this repositiory you can clone this repo, then in your terminal or shell write the following and hit enter
```
git clone https://github.com/sablexis/pycite.git
```

alternatively, you can also download the code as a zip file from the same code button!

Once it's downloaded, you will need to navigate to it with the terminal, it'll look something like this

```
cd /Users/Your Name/Downloads/Sandy_Sabrina_These_Script
```
**TIP**: if you right click and copy the zip file/file folder you downloaded/clone you can paste it directly in the terminal and it will provide the file path.

once you hit enter the next command you'll write will be as follows, it'll open the citation window (may take a few seconds)

```
Python3 src/pycite.py
```

## Design Decisions
I originally came up with the idea of making this a model view controller thing because I was taking COMP 2711 at the time and wanted to have another fun project to practice with!

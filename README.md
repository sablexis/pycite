# pycite
creating citations from a csv dataset

## Project Overview
Our goal with this project was to automate a tedious task in order to make it easier for others to cite all the wonderful undergraduate research conducted here at Mount Allsion University! By piping in an existing dataset of all our digitally available theses, create an additional column with correctly formatted APA citation

## Design Decisions
## Rationale Behind Architecture
## Known Limitations
## Future Improvements
As of right now, our citation machine only creates APA citations but, we'll look to expand to other citation styles soon
